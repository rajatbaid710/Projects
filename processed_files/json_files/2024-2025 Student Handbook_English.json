Policies are established to create an orderly, friendly, learning environment for each student.\n\nThis handbook contains a great deal of required and useful information for a large number of students and parents. It cannot be as personal as we would like. Therefore, we address students, not directly as \"you,\" but rather as \"the student,\" \"student,\" or \"children.\" The term \"the student's parent\" may refer to the parent, legal guardian, or another person who has agreed to assume responsibility for the student. This handbook intends to communicate essential information concerning the operation of the District's schools. The information provided should assist parents and students in learning about the schools and knowing what the schools expect of students.\n\nSchools exist for the students' use. It is hoped that students will use them to the fullest extent.\n\n## Policies\n\nMuch of the information in this handbook is based on policies adopted by the Leander ISD Board of Trustees . Copies of these policies are available through the LISD website, www.leanderisd.org, or on any campus or district facility.\n\nThis handbook is required reading for all students . The information is also made available to parents to keep them informed about procedures. More information on policies and guidelines is available from school principals. Questions regarding this handbook or its contents should be directed to the campus principal.\n\nThe Student Handbook is available through the Leander ISD website at www.leanderisd.org. In addition, upon request, hard copies of the 2024-2025 Student Handbook may be requested through the office of the Assistant Principals.\n\nReferences made to policies in the student handbook consist of summaries or partial excerpts from the complete policy text. The official policy manual adopted by the Board of Trustees remains the authoritative reference. Any policy change adopted during the life of this handbook will take precedence over any conflicting statement in this handbook. A copy of the policy manual is available on each campus and in each department.\n\nLeander Independent School District P.O.

This documentation must justify the reason for the absence to ensure proper coding.\n- ● Be aware of their right to temporarily remove their child(ren) from an instructional activity that conflicts with their religious or moral beliefs. Such a removal cannot be for the purpose of avoiding a test and may not prevent the student(s) from meeting compulsory attendance requirements. Further, such removal does not exempt the student from satisfying grade level or graduation requirements as determined by the school and by the Texas Education Agency.\n- ● Review their child's school records when needed. A parent may review attendance records, test scores, grades, disciplinary records, counseling records, psychological records, applications for admission, health and immunization information, other medical records, teacher and counselor evaluations, reports of behavioral patterns, and state assessment instruments that have been administered.\n- ● Monitor their child's progress and contact teachers as needed.\n- ● Take advantage of all opportunities to stay informed regarding their child's activities and whole school activities.\n- ● Become a school volunteer. For further information, contact your campus.\n- ● Participate in campus parent organizations. The activities are varied, ranging from band boosters to campus and District committees that assist the Board of Trustees in formulating educational goals and objectives for campuses and the district.\n- ● Grant or deny any written request from the District to make a videotape or voice recording of their child(ren) unless the videotape or voice recording is to be used for school safety, relates to classroom instruction or a co-curricular or extracurricular activity, or relates to media coverage of the school as permitted by law.\n- ● Make every effort to provide for the physical and emotional needs of their child(ren).\n- ● Help their child(ren) understand the importance of being engaged and following classroom and campus policies and procedures.\n- ● Ensure their child(ren) attends school regularly, on time, and remains in compliance with LISD policy FEA and Texas state law.\n- ● Encourage and assist their child(ren) to develop proper study habits at home.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● Participate in all scheduled conferences to discuss their child's school progress and welfare.\n- ● Discuss report cards and school assignments with their child.\n- ● Inform the school of any special educational or medical needs or circumstances particular to their child(ren).\n- ● Maintain up-to-date home, work and emergency telephone numbers and other pertinent information.\n- ● Exercise parental control. (Under the Family Code, a parent is legally liable for property damage caused by the negligent, willful or malicious conduct of their child(ren).)\n\n## Student Responsibilities\n\n- ● Come to school regularly, on time, and remain in compliance with LISD policy FEA and Texas state law.\n- ● Attend class prepared and ready to learn.\n- ● Participate in learning activities.\n- ● Practice ethical principles in all areas of the school day, including non-class time.\n- ● Follow Student Code of Conduct and campus expectations.\n- ● Communicate with their parents about their school assignments, homework, projects, report cards, cafeteria charges, etc.\n- ● Work with school staff in taking ownership of their own learning.\n- ● Dress in compliance with Leander ISD Dress Code.\n- ● Interact with other students appropriately.\n- ● Report any unsafe situations to school authorities.\n\n## Decision-Making\n\nThe quality of life at school depends on the decisions students make. If they make good decisions, then they can avoid troublesome situations at home, at school, or with friends. Making decisions can often be difficult because others may try to talk our children into doing something wrong. They may dare them, tease them, or even call them names if they don't go along with the crowd. Students can use this four-step formula for making responsible decisions. Stop, Think, Evaluate, Proceed.\n\n- ● S TOP. Take time to look around you. Know where you are and who is with you. Stand straight. Appear self-confident. Look the other person in the eye.\n- ● T HINK. To think clearly: Listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Hear what is being suggested to you or asked of you. Realize whether the situation or suggestion has the potential for trouble.\n- ● E VALUATE. What will the consequences of my actions be? Ask yourself: Will I cause someone else to get hurt or to get into trouble? Will my action break a school rule? Will my action break a law? What GOOD things can happen? What BAD things can happen? Is it worth it in the long run?\n- ● P ROCEED. Respond or act in a way that will avoid the trouble. Remove yourself from the situation. Leave. Change the subject. Make another suggestion. Ignore what was said or suggested. Make a joke of it. Say: 'Friends don't ask friends to do something that will get them into trouble.' Say NO! You are important. There is only one of you in the whole world. You don't need to wait for others to make your decisions for you. If you think you are right and try to be honest and fair, you will probably choose the right way to act. You are the one who can make your school days happy days.\n\n## Self-Discipline\n\nOne  important  lesson  students  learn  in  school  is  self-discipline .  Self-discipline  is  the  key  to  good  conduct  and  proper consideration  for  other  people.  For  those  who  do  not  exercise  self-discipline,  the  following  alternatives  may  be used/assigned by school officials:\n\n- ● Community Service - a task assigned as a result of failure to show respect for people or property.\n- ● Counseling - a conference with a teacher, counselor, or principal.\n- ● Withdrawal of Privileges - a time apart from classmates for a portion of a day or more.\n- ● Parent Conference - a discussion with the student, his/her parents, the teacher, a counselor, and/or the principal.\n- ● Detention - a time apart from classmates assigned during recess, lunch, or before/after school. Parents will be notified.\n- ● Suspension - a serious disciplinary measure that results in the loss of the privilege of attending class or school for a designated time period.\n- ● Alternative Education - a placement in the Leander Extended Opportunity Center (LEO). This is a highly structured environment for students who are not experiencing success in the regular classroom.\n- ● Expulsion - a serious disciplinary measure resulting in the loss of the privilege of attending a LISD school and placement at a juvenile detention center school for a time period.\n- ● Judicial Proceeding - a legal measure that may be taken if necessary.\n- ● Peer Mediation - a conflict resolution approach to problem solving between students.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● Individualized behavior plan - a contract based on student behaviors.\n- ● Please see Student Code of Conduct for other behavior management techniques.\n\n## Opportunities for Involvement: Campus Involvement\n\nEducation succeeds best when there is a strong partnership between home and school, a partnership that thrives on communication. The school is always happy to have visitors. Anyone, including parents, who wish to visit our school must first come to the office to sign in. Parents are partners with teachers, administrators, and the Board, and are encouraged to:\n\n- ● Encourage children to put a high priority on education and commit to making the most of the educational opportunities the school provides.\n- ● Review the information in the Student Handbook (especially the Student Code of Conduct ) with your child (located at www.leanderisd.org under 'Parents and Students' tab). Parents with questions are encouraged to contact campus administration.\n- ● Become familiar with all your child's school activities and with the academic programs offered in the District. Discuss any questions with school personnel.\n- ● Exercise your right to review teaching materials, textbooks, and other aids, and to examine tests that have been administered to your child.\n- ● Review your child's student records when needed.\n- ● Temporarily remove your child from the classroom if an instructional activity in which your child is scheduled to participate conflicts with your religious or moral beliefs. The removal cannot be for the purpose of avoiding a test and may not extend for an entire semester. Further, your child must satisfy grade-level and graduation requirements as determined by the school and by TEA.\n- ● Talk to your child(ren) about school and ask to see their learning opportunities and evidence of learning,homework and graded papers.\n- ● Participate with your child in campus activities.\n- ● To schedule a visit to the classroom, please arrange it in advance with the campus. During the visit, parents will be accompanied by campus support staff.\n\n## Volunteer Opportunities\n\nLeander  ISD  encourages  parents  to  become  knowledgeable  about  and  involved  in  their  students'  education  through LISD's Volunteer and Mentor programs as well as Parent Teacher Associations/Organizations (PTA/O) and booster clubs. Each year parents and community members volunteer tens of thousands of hours for Leander ISD students. Information regarding these programs is available in the campus office or the campus website.\n\n## Home Access Center\n\nAnother way that parents can become involved in their students' education is by taking the time to sign up for our Home Access  Center  (HAC).  Leander  ISD's  HAC  program  allows  parents  to  view  information  online  about  their  student's academic progress and attendance. Parents of Leander ISD students can use HAC to access their child(ren) 's grades and attendance. The HAC link is located on every campus website. Report cards and interim progress reports will be available in the HAC system.\n\n## Campus Site-Based Planning Committee\n\nThe  Campus  Site-Based  Planning  Committee  is  an  advisory  group  that  addresses  the  improvement  of  educational opportunities for all students. Parents may also be interested in serving on the Campus Site-Based Planning Committee. This  advisory  group  of  teachers,  parents,  and  community  members  works  with the principal on specific campus-based concerns. For further information, contact the school office.\n\n## District-Wide Committees\n\nAt  various  times,  District-wide  committees  are  formed  to  address  different  needs/issues.  Announcements  for  these committees may come through campus and/or District newsletters.\n\n## School Health Advisory Council\n\nThe Leander ISD School Health Advisory Council (SHAC), in accordance with the state (19 TAC 74.31) and district (EHAA (Legal)) policy, ensures local community values are reflected in the District's health education instruction. The council's duties include making recommendations on the number of hours of health instruction, curriculum related to the prevention of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, human sexuality and the coordinated school health program. For information about the LISD SHAC, visit Leander ISD SHAC website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of Trustees Meetings\n\nThe Leander ISD Board typically meets on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month.

Parents may request their assessment results from the staff member who administered the test.\n\n## Health Excuses for Physical Education\n\nPhysical Education is a required course, and all students must participate. When a child is at school, but his/her parents believe he should be excused from P.E. activities, the request to be excused must be in writing. If it is to be excused for more than three (3) days, the note must be from a doctor. Repeated requests to be excused from P.E. will not be honored without a note from a doctor. On the days that a child does not participate in P.E. class, he/she will also not participate in recess. Other P.E. programs will be provided for students unable to participate in the regular P.E. program.\n\n## Physical Education\n\n## (Secondary Only)\n\nStudents  are  required  to  earn  one  (1)  credit  from  the  following  courses  for  graduation:  Lifetime  Fitness  and  Wellness Pursuits or Skill-Based Lifetime Activities.

Parents may request their assessment results from the staff member who administered the test.\n\n## Athletics\n\nWe believe that an exemplary athletic program is an extension of the classroom. As such, athletics offers students an opportunity to develop and grow physically, intellectually, emotionally, and socially. The positive benefits that participation in athletics offers include, but are not limited to, are self-esteem, self-discipline, self-confidence, goal setting, commitment and the development of team spirit. Furthermore, participants learn the values associated with competition and benefit from the experience of both victory and defeat.\n\nFor more information regarding LISD Athletics, visit our webpage at LISD Athletics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human Sexuality Curriculum\n\nLeander ISD provides puberty instruction to students in grades 4-6 and human sexuality instruction to students in grades 7-9  in  accordance  to  Board  policy  (EHAA,  Legal)  and  state  law  (Ed  Code  28.004  (c)).  The  content  of  the  curriculum includes instruction related to human sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). State law requires districts that provide instruction on human sexuality to focus the curriculum on abstinence as the preferred choice of behavior for unmarried persons of school age.\n\nPuberty and human sexuality instruction in Leander ISD will be limited to the content, courses, and guidelines specified in the  LISD  -  Human  Sexuality  Curriculum.  Participation  in  the  puberty  and  human  sexuality  instruction  is  voluntary  and students  can  Opt-In  to  the  instruction  by  written  request  of  a  parent  or  legal  guardian.  Parents  or  legal  guardians will receive  notice  in  the  form  of  a  districtwide  email  about  the  teaching  of  the curriculum. Parents or legal guardians may preview the teaching materials, located in each secondary campus library. LISD School Health Advisory Council (SHAC) provides  input  to  the  development  and/or  review  of  the  human  sexuality  curriculum.   For  information  about  the  LISD SHAC, visit Leander ISD SHAC website.\n\n## ATTENDANCE\n\nRegular school attendance is essential for students to make the most of their education - to benefit from teacher-led school activities, to build each day's learning on the previous day's, and to grow as  individuals. Absences from class may seriously disrupt a student's mastery of instructional materials; therefore, the student and parent should make every effort to avoid unnecessary absences. Two state laws - one dealing with compulsory attendance, the other with attendance for course  credit  -  are  of  special  interest  to  students  and  parents.  They  are  listed  below  under  Compulsory  School Attendance Laws and Attendance for Class Credit or Final Grade.\n\n## Home Access Center (HAC)\n\nLeander ISD has a useful tool to help parents and students track their attendance and grades. The HAC program allows parents  an  opportunity to view  this  information  online.  The  HAC  link  can  be  found  on  the  District  website  at www.leanderisd.org  under  the  'Quick  Links'  section  or  at  https://www.leanderisd.org/homeaccesscenter/.  In  addition, parents  will  be  notified  when  their  child  is  absent  through  Remind.  As  a  parent  of  a  student  in  Leander  ISD,  you  are already enrolled in Remind. If you need to correct your contact information, please use the returning student registration tool, or contact your child's campus registrar with the updated information.\n\n## Campus Truancy Prevention Measures to Improve Attendance\n\nCampuses provide a multitude of Truancy Prevention Measures to support improving student attendance prior to a referral to a truancy court. These steps may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. Notifications when students are absent.\n- 2. Attendance warning notifications for excessive unverified/unexcused and excessive excused absences.\n- 3. Invitation to view a Truancy Prevention Video.\n- 4. Referral to school and community resources.\n- 5. Notification of hours owed to regain credit.\n- 6. Attendance Behavior Improvement Plan (ABIP).\n\n## Laws to All Parents/Guardians of LISD Students\n\nThe attendance section serves as the official required notice per Texas Education Code for parents and/or students who might have attendance related issues. School districts are required to provide parents with information regarding the Compulsory School Attendance Laws.\n\nIf a student is absent for ten (10) or more days or parts of days in a six-month period in the same school year:\n\n- 1. The student's parent is subject to prosecution under the Texas Education Code; and\n- 2. The student is subject to a referral to Truancy Court under the Texas Education Code.\n\nIt is the parent's duty to monitor their student's school attendance and require their student to attend school. Parents may request a conference with school officials to discuss absences.\n\nA  parent  not  receiving  an  additional  notice  from  the  school  is  not  a  defense  to  prosecution.  In  this  section,  'parent' includes a person standing in parental relation. Legal action may be filed against the child, the parent(s), legal guardian(s) and/or any person(s) standing in a parental relation to the child.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The law in the State of Texas requires a child to attend school. Texas Education Code states:\n\n- 1. A child who is required to attend school under this section shall attend school each school day for the entire period the program of instruction is provided.\n- 2. Unless specifically exempted by Section 25.086, a child who is at least six years of age, or who is younger than six years of age and has previously been enrolled in first grade, and who has not yet reached the child's 19th birthday shall attend school.\n- 3. On enrollment in prekindergarten or kindergarten, a child shall attend school.\n- 4. Unless specifically exempted by Section 25.086, a student enrolled in a school district must attend:\n- i. an extended-year program for which the student is eligible that is provided by the\n- ii. district for students identified as likely not to be promoted to the next grade level or tutorial\n- iii. classes required by the district under Section 29.084;\n- iv. an accelerated reading instruction program to which the student is assigned under Section 28.006(g);\n- v. a basic skills program to which the student is assigned under Section 29.086; or\n- vi. a summer program provided under Section 37.008(l) or Section 37.021.\n- 5. A person who voluntarily enrolls in school or voluntarily attends school after the person's 18th birthday shall attend school each school day for the entire period the program of instruction is offered. A school district may revoke for the remainder of the school year the enrollment of a person who has more than five absences in a semester that are not excused under Section 25.087. A person whose enrollment is revoked under this subsection may be considered an unauthorized person on school district grounds for purposes of Section 37.107.\n\n## Attendance for Class Credit or Final Grade\n\nPer Texas Education Code §25.092, to receive credit in a class, a student in any grade level from kindergarten through grade 12 may not be given credit or a final grade for a class unless the student is in attendance for at least 90 percent of the days the class is offered. A student who attends at least 75 percent but fewer than 90 percent of the days the class is offered may receive credit for the class or a final grade if he or she completes a plan approved by the principal that allows the student to fulfill the instructional requirements for the class.\n\nWith the exception of absences due to serious or life-threatening illness or related treatment, all absences, excused or unexcused,  may  be  held  against  a  student's  attendance  requirement.  To  determine  whether  there  were  extenuating circumstances for any absences, the principal attendance committee will consider:\n\n- ● Whether  the  student  has  mastered  the  essential  knowledge  and  skills  and  maintained  passing  grades  in  the course or subject.\n- ● Whether the student has completed makeup work satisfactorily. If the student completes makeup work, absences for extracurricular activities will be considered extenuating circumstances.\n- ● Whether the student or the student's parent had any control over the absences.\n- ● Any information presented by the student or parent to the committee about the absences.\n\nThe student or parent may appeal the committee's decision to the board by following policy FNG(LOCAL).\n\n## Official Attendance Recording Time\n\nElementary - Within the first hour of the start of the school day. Contact your campus for the specific time. Secondary - Ten (10) minutes into the class period except for the period when official attendance is taken or in a course other than a flex or advisory period.\n\nLeander Extended Opportunity (LEO) - 9:45 a.m.\n\n## Absence Classifications\n\nWhether for full days or parts of days, the following information about absences applies:\n\n## Excused Absences:\n\nExcused absences include, but are not limited to personal illness, funeral/memorial, quarantine, or  weather or road conditions  that make travel dangerous. Students are required to attend at least 90 percent of the days the class is offered. The student will be required to make up excessive excused absences. Unless the absence is for a statutorily allowed reason under compulsory attendance laws, the district is not required to excuse any absence, even if the parent provides a note explaining the absence.\n\n## Unexcused Absences:\n\nAn  unexcused  absence  is  any  absence that  does  not  meet  the  definition  of  an  excused  absence  (examples: personal business, vacation, traffic, car trouble, etc.).\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following  absences are considered 'State Approved Non-Absences. When a student is absent, parents or guardians should submit any necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence. A 'State Approved Non-Absence' is one for which the District still receives funding and the student is marked  in  the  attendance  system  with  a  code  that  is  equivalent  to  present.  'State  Approved  Non-Absences' include:\n\n## Absences for Religious Holy Days\n\nThe District shall excuse students from attending school for the purpose of observing religious holy days when it is a  tenet  of  the  faith  that  the student must be absent from school during such time. The District shall excuse the student for days on which the religious holy days are observed and for one day on which the student must travel to  and  one  day  on  which  the  student  must  travel  from  the  site  where  the  holy  days will be observed. When a student  is  absent,  parents  or  guardians  should  submit  any  necessary  documentation  as  soon  as  possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence.  It is preferable to submit the proper documentation  prior to the student's absence.\n\n## Absences for Military Dependents\n\nA student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services and has been called to  duty  for,  is  on  leave  from,  or  immediately  returned  from  deployment  to  a  combat  zone  or  combat  support posting, shall be granted additional excused absences to visit with the student's parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or guardian. See Policy FEA (LEGAL), §25.087 Texas Education Code for additional information.\n\n## Absences for College Visits and Career Investigations\n\nThe District may excuse a student from attending school to visit an institution of higher education accredited by a generally  recognized  accrediting  organization during the student's junior and senior years of high school for the purpose  of  determining  the  student's  interest  in  attending  the  institution  of  higher  education  or  a  professional workplace for the purpose of career investigation. The District may not excuse more than two (2) days during the student's junior year and two (2) days during the student's senior year for each type of visit. Official verification of the  absence  from  the  institution  of  higher  education  or  career  investigation  workplace  must  submitted  in accordance with the process outlined on the high school website. When a student is absent, parents or guardians should submit any necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence.\n\n## Other State Approved Absences\n\nPlease see Texas Education Code §25.087 for a complete list of state-approved excused absences.\n\n## Medical Absences\n\nA  student  may  be  excused  for  a  temporary  (partial  day)  absence  due  to  an  appointment  with  health  care professionals for either the student or the student's child if the student begins classes or returns to school on the same  day  of  the  appointment/treatment .  When  a  student  is  absent,  parents  or  guardians  should  submit  any necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence.\n\n## Tardies\n\nIf a student arrives after the start of school, the student must check in at the attendance office. At the Elementary level, a student is considered tardy if they arrive to school after the start of the school day. If a student is more than one (1) hour late to school, he/she will be marked absent for the entire day. At the Middle School level, a student is considered tardy if they arrive to class within the first ten (10) minutes after the class has begun. If a student is more than ten (10) minutes late to class, the student is marked absent . At the High School level, a tardy for each class period varies according to unique campus bell schedules.\n\n## Failure to Attend\n\nA student fails to attend school when the student misses a class or classes without parental consent (often called 'skipping'). A student who fails to attend school is subject to campus disciplinary consequences.\n\n## Hours Owed/Make-up Attendance Hours\n\nAny student who does not attend 90% of the days a class is offered (excused or unexcused) will be required to make- up attendance hours. Students and/or parents will be notified of the hours a student owes and a plan will be developed with the administration on acceptable ways the student may make-up the hours owed. Please see LISD Board Policy FEC for additional information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Verification of Absence\n\nAll  student  absences  must  be  verified  in  writing  by  a  parent/guardian.  All  absences  are  documented  as  unverifiedunexcused  until  verification  is  received  from  the  parent/guardian  by  the  school  attendance  clerk.  When  a  student  is absent, parents or guardians should submit any necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of  the  absence.   A  hand-written  note  or  an  email  sent  from  the  parent's  email  address  on  file  is  acceptable as verification. Upon receipt of verification from a parent, the unverified/unexcused absence will be updated.\n\n## All verifications from parents should include the following:\n\n- 1. Full legal name of student\n- 2. Student's ID number\n- 3. Student's grade\n- 4. Date(s) of absence\n- 5. Reason for absence\n- 6. Parent's signature (if hand written)\n- 7. Parent's phone number\n- 8. Current date\n\nImportant: When the student returns to school on the day of or after a medical appointment, it is best if  the  student presents written verification of the medical appointment from the medical office. The above information can be added to the  notice  from  a  medical  provider.  When  a  student  is  absent,  parents  or  guardians  should  submit  any  necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence.\n\nAs per LISD Board policy FEC (LOCAL): If a student has established a questionable pattern of absences, the principal or attendance committee may also require that the student present a physician's or clinic's statement of illness after a single day's  absence  as  a  condition  of  classifying  the  absence  as  one  for  which  there  are  extenuating  circumstances  (state approved non-absences).\n\nIf  your  child  has  a  chronic  health  condition  that  requires  frequent  absences  or  medical appointments, it is the parent's responsibility to communicate  this  information  to the school. The  parents  will  be  asked  to  provide  supporting documentation from medical professionals annually. When a student is absent, parents or guardians should submit any necessary documentation as soon as possible; recommended within 48 hours of the absence.\n\nIf a  student  is  absent  because  of  a  serious  or  life-threatening  illness  or  related  treatment  that  makes  a  student's attendance infeasible,  a  parent  must  provide  certification  from  a  physician  licensed  to  practice  in  Texas specifying the student's illness and the anticipated period of absence related to the illness or treatment.\n\nIf the student is 18 years old or older or has been declared an emancipated minor by the court, the student may sign in place of a parent or guardian. Parents/Guardians will be notified by the school when their child is absent. If parents do not want to receive the notifications, they may contact their child's campus.\n\n## Absences for Special Events\n\nThe  attendance  section  of  this  handbook  should  be  reviewed  before  making  plans  to  miss  school  for  any  reason.  A parent/guardian  may  obtain  a  form  from  the  attendance  office  to  notify  the  campus  of  an  absence.  An  absence  for  a special event may be coded as excused or unexcused.\n\n## Attendance and School Related Activities\n\nIf a student is absent (full or partial day) on the day of a school-related event (i.e.: dance, theater performance, volleyball/football game), the student may not be able to participate without a valid written excuse from a physician.\n\n## Absences for Extracurricular and UIL (University Interscholastic League) Activities\n\nPlease see LISD Board Policy FM (local) for details. Any absence resulting from a student's participation in an activity for an organization not school related is considered unexcused.\n\n## Planned or Extended Absences\n\n## Extracurriculars:\n\nAny student absence from class due to extracurricular activities will be responsible for obtaining assignments prior to the absence. Students who miss class due to extracurricular activities are required to submit missed assignments and take\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nany missed quizzes or exams. the student and teacher will work together to determine a reasonable amount of time to complete missed work.\n\n## Obtaining Assignments\n\nIf  a  student  is  absent  due  to  an  extended  illness  (5  or  more  days)  and  wishes  to  get assignments before returning to school, the student and /or family member may contact the classroom teacher to request assignments. A minimum of two days is needed to obtain work.\n\nThere may be instances when work is needed before an absence occurs (ex. scheduled surgery). In order to obtain this work,  a  parent  may  submit  a  note  to  the  teacher  explaining  the  reason  for  the  absence  and  the  dates  of  absence.  A minimum of two days Is needed to obtain work.\n\n## Procedures to Follow When Leaving Early\n\nBecause class time is important, appointments should be scheduled, if possible, at times when the student will not miss instructional  time.  However,  if  a  student  should  need  to  leave  early  for  an  appointment,  please  contact  the  campus' attendance office for the procedure to follow.\n\n## Making Up Work\n\nIn order to be successful in school, students are expected to turn in work on time. If a student is absent, every effort will be made to help him/her make up missed work. Students will be helped by following these guidelines:\n\n- 1. When a child returns to school, it is his/her responsibility to ask the teachers what assignments were missed. The student will have one day of make-up time for each day of absence. (Example: One (1) day absent - one (1) day to make up work. If a child would like assignments before returning to school, parents are asked to call the office before  9:00  a.m.  to  request  make-up  work. Assignments will then be ready to be picked up in the school office between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m.\n- 2. Make-up work for prearranged absences should be requested from the classroom teacher.\n\n## 'Take Your Child to Work' Day\n\nLeander ISD observes 'Take Your Child to Work' day during the summer. Absences will be unexcused if a student observes this event during the school year.\n\n## Attendance Appeals\n\nA parent who wishes to appeal make-up hours may write a letter of appeal to the campus assistant principal and turn it in to the registrar. Letters may be submitted at any time during the semester but no later than ten (10) calendar days after the last day of classes for that semester.\n\nThe assistant principal will review the appeal request with the student's teacher and additional teachers (as appropriate) to determine  whether  the  student  should  be  eligible  for  amended  make  up  hours.  The  assistant  principal  may  take  into consideration attendance records, doctor's notes, prior arrangements with school administration, extenuating circumstances, educational performance and behavior.\n\nAfter review of the case, the assistant principal will decide to uphold, modify or waive make up hours. The completion of make-up hours is a factor in student promotion. The parent may choose to appeal the decision to the campus principal.\n\n## Absences for Transfer Students\n\nStudents who enroll in a class during the semester from outside Leander ISD will have attendance prorated based on the number of days remaining in the semester. Students must attend classes 90 percent of the time classes are offered while enrolled to obtain credit for the class(es).\n\nStudents transferring out of the District who have exceeded the number of absences allowable for credit will not receive credit. Transcripts sent to other school districts will reflect no credit because of excessive absences. Students may petition for credit by mail or in person with the same opportunities to present their case as all other students.\n\n## Leander ISD Attendance Codes\n\nA\n\nAbsence-Excused\n\nT Late to Class but Present\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| C   | Co-curricular School Related Absence  (not UIL)   | U   | Unexcused Absence                           |\n|-----|---------------------------------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------|\n| D   | Absent w/Doctor Note                              | V   | Military Recruitment Visit                  |\n| E   | Election/Voting Clerk                             | X   | Extra-Curricular School Related  Absence    |\n| G   | Other Instruction on Campus                       | Y   | Leave Early                                 |\n| H   | Homebound/CEHI                                    | 1   | College Visit                               |\n| I   | ISS Placement                                     | 2   | Testing                                     |\n| J   | Homebound Non-Serviced Day                        | 3   | State Approved Non-Absence                  |\n| M   | Medical Appointment - Doctor Note                 | 5   | Late Excused Absence                        |\n| N   | Funeral/Memorial                                  | 6   | Late Unexcused Absence                      |\n| O   | Unverified - Unexcused                            | 8   | District Approved                           |\n| P   | Present                                           | 9   | Absence from Sub Campus                     |\n| R   | Nurse Sent Home                                   | 0   | Military Deployment                         |\n| S   | Suspended                                         | TA  | Late to Class, Absent                       |\n| 3H  | Religious Holiday Day                             | LT  | Life Threatening Illness/Treatment          |\n| 3C  | Court Ordered Appearance                          |     | PRP Homebound w/Pregnancy Related  Services |\n| CI  | Career Investigation                              |     |                                             |\n\n## HEALTHSERVICES\n\nPlease  note,  guidance  provided  that  includes,  but  is  now  limited  to,  illness  or  presence  of  illness  may  be  subject  to changes depending on the presence of any current communicable disease(s). If changes to guidance is needed, Leander ISD will ensure proper communication to all stakeholders in a timely manner.\n\n## Clinic Overview\n\nLeander ISD is committed to providing a healthy, safe and ready to learn environment for all of our students. Students who become ill or injured at school will be evaluated to determine the need for further treatment. The campus nurse will assess each student and provide necessary care within their scope of practice. Designated and trained clinic personnel do not diagnose  illnesses  or  injuries,  but  will  provide  basic  care.  A  parent/guardian  will  be  notified  as  deemed  appropriate. Parents/guardians are encouraged to contact the campus clinic to discuss any health concern(s) they have for their child.\n\nThe  campus  clinic  is  not  the  appropriate  place  for  monitoring  students  who  need  a  'brain  break'  or  to  sit  out  of P.E./recess. This is due  to unnecessary  exposure  to  illness, emergency  situations,  and  the  need  to  maintain confidentiality.\n\nLISD recognizes the importance of partnering with parents/guardians to ensure a healthy environment for all our students and staff. By sending your child to school, you are attesting that your child has a very low risk of carrying or spreading any disease.  A  student  who  has  a fever of 100.0 Fahrenheit or above, vomiting or diarrhea will need to stay home until the listed symptom(s) have resolved for twenty-four (24) hours without the use of medications. Refer to Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7 for more detailed information.\n\nIf a student has been sent home ill or with an injury requiring an appointment with a physician, or hospitalized, a note from the student's physician stating the date the student can return to school is required. Students who come to school with an injury  requiring  interventions  such  as  surgery,  casts,  compression  wraps,  crutches,  wheelchairs,  etc.,  must  have  a physician's note diagnosing the injury and prescribing the assistive device as well as what activities the student is/is not allowed to do while under the physician's care for the injury.\n\n## Emergencies, Injuries and Illnesses at School\n\nIt  is  important  to remember that schools must exclude students with certain illnesses from school for periods of time as identified  in  state  rules.  Leander  ISD  is  required  to  report  certain  communicable  diseases  and  illnesses  to  the  Texas Department of State Health Services (Tx DSHS) and/or our local/regional health authority. A full list of conditions for which\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  school  must  exclude  children  can  be  obtained  from  the  campus  clinic.  Clinic  personnel  follow  recommendations provided by the Tx DSHS and/or local/regional health authorities. Contact the campus clinic if you have questions or if you are concerned about whether your child should stay home.\n\nPlease be sure to provide the school with current contact information. If it is determined that the child should go home, staff will contact the listed parent/guardian(s). If a parent/guardian cannot be reached, a listed emergency contact will be contacted. When it is determined that the student must go home due to a non-emergent illness/injury, the expectation is that  the student be picked up within an hour of the parent/guardian being contacted. No student will be allowed to drive home unless permission has been obtained from a parent/guardian via e-mail.\n\nIn the event 911 is called for a student, a parent/guardian will be notified immediately.\n\nLeander ISD is not responsible for costs of treating injuries or EMS calls and cannot assume liability for any other costs associated with an injury.\n\nMedication may be administered by designated Leander ISD personnel in compliance with the procedures outlined below. All  medication  dispensed  in  the  clinic  must  have  a  signed  physician/health  care  provider  order,  including over-the-counter medication. The Nursing Practice Act dictates which licensed medical professionals a registered nurse may carry out medication orders from. At this time, licensed chiropractors are not included, therefore, their orders will not be accepted.\n\n- 1. Prescription medication must be unexpired and in a prescription bottle/box accompanied by a pharmacy label that states the student's name, medication name and directions for dispensing the medication.\n- a. Prescription order must be written/signed by a physician licensed to practice in Texas.\n- b. A new order is required for any dosage or medication change on prescription medication.\n- c. Controlled substances will be counted, and quantity verified by parent/guardian and designated LISD personnel upon delivery and pickup.\n- 2. Over-the-counter medication must be unexpired and in an unopened bottle or box.\n- a. Order must be written/signed by a physician licensed to practice in Texas.\n- b. A new order is required for any dosage or medication change on over-the-counter medication.\n- 3. Narcotic pain medications prescribed for temporary medical conditions will not be administered or kept on campus.\n- 4. All medications needed during the school day must be provided and delivered by parent/guardian.\n- 5. Medication(s) will not be accepted without the appropriate completed form(s), including all required signatures.\n- 6. A separate form must be completed for each medication provided for a student.\n- 7. All clinic forms must be signed on or after June 1 to be valid for the upcoming school year and will apply to that school year only.\n- 8. Initial/first dose of any medication will not be administered in the clinic.\n- 9. Medication must be kept in the school clinic and administered by designated LISD personnel.\n- 10. No medication will be sent home with a student . Parents/Guardians must pick up all medications whether prescription or over the-counter.\n- 11.  Scheduled medications that can be administered at home will not be administered at school unless a specific time of administration during school hours is prescribed by a physician.\n- 12. A student may be allowed to self-carry and self-administer emergency medication as long as the appropriate self-carry form is received by the clinic. The form must be completed and include all required signatures.\n- 13. LISD personnel will not administer any medications that are not FDA approved. This includes but is not limited to herbal substances, anabolic steroids and dietary supplements. Exceptions may be granted if prescribed by a physician and required by the IEP or Section 504 plan of a student with a disability. Reliable information must be provided in writing and signed by the prescribing physician regarding the safe use of the product including side effects, toxicity, drug interactions and adverse effects.\n\nIn accordance with the Nurse Practice Act, Texas Administrative Code, Section 217.11, the Registered Nurse and the Licensed Vocational Nurse have the responsibility and authority to refuse to administer medications that, in the nurse's judgment, are contraindicated for administration to the student.\n\n## Standing Orders\n\nLeander Health Services has Over-the-Counter Standing orders that each student can assess during the school day if the parent/guardian has not opted-out during registration. Over-the-Counter Standing Orders can be viewed in detail on the Leander ISD Health Services Webpage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● Opt-Out Option:\n- ● If you prefer your child not to have access to OTC standing order medications during the school day, please access the Leander ISD website to opt-out. These registration links enable each campus nurse to generate an up-to-date report with the names of students whose parents/guardians have opted-out. These links on the Leander ISD website titled: New Students to Leander ISD and Returning Student Verification can be used to opt-out.\n\n## Unassigned Epinephrine Auto-injectors\n\nIn accordance with Chapter 38, Subchapter E of the Education Code, the board has adopted a policy to allow authorized school  personnel  who  have  been  adequately trained to administer an unassigned epinephrine auto-injector to a person who is reasonably believed to be experiencing a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\n\nAn  'unassigned  epinephrine  auto-injector'  is  an  epinephrine  auto-injector  prescribed  by  an  authorized  health-care provider in the name of the school issued with a non-patient-specific standing delegation order for the administration of an epinephrine auto-injector.\n\nEpinephrine auto-injectors include brand-name devices such as EpiPens®.\n\nAuthorized  and  trained  individuals  may  administer  an  epinephrine  auto-injector  at  any  time  to  a  person  experiencing anaphylaxis on a school campus.\n\nThe district will ensure that at each campus a sufficient number of school personnel are trained to administer epinephrine so that at least one trained individual is present on campus during regular school hours and whenever school personnel are physically on site for school-sponsored activities.\n\n## Unassigned Opioid Antagonist\n\nTexas SB 1462 states that anyone can possess or administer opioid antagonist medications. The acts covered in these Standing  Delegation  Orders  are  limited  to  the  following  general  medical  symptoms  that  can  be  addressed  by  the medications  following  package  directions.  Interventions  shall  be  documented  in  the  student  care  record.  A  parent  or guardian will be notified of any use of an unassigned opioid antagonist medication on their child; the intervention will be documented in the student's health care record.\n\nThe following medication are to be used by the Registered Nurse (RN) or Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) or designated employee(s) who have signed the attestation statement for training. Narcan (naloxone HCI nasal spray) is indicated for reversal of opioid overdose in the setting of respiratory depression or unresponsiveness. It may be delivered intranasally with  the  use  of  a  mucosal  atomizer  device.  Generic  drugs  may  be  substituted  for  Narcan  if  it  is  not available, or cost supersedes the generic.\n\nStudents cannot self-carry an opioid antagonist unless it is prescribed by a physician, student has a documented history of  opioid  addiction,  seeking  treatment  for the addiction and required by the IEP or Section 504 plan of a student with a disability.\n\n## General Physician Guidance for School Clinic\n\nIn conjunction with nursing judgment, the following guidance will be considered by the campus nurse when providing care to students.\n\n## Application of Heat or Cold for Major or Minor Trauma\n\nWith major trauma, where fractured bones or torn soft tissues are suspected, the standard approach is the use of cold treatment  for  the  initial  2  to  3  days.  Cold  constricts  blood  vessels,  lessens  the  leakage  of  blood  and  proteins  into the interstitial spaces and can decrease tissue swelling. Heat is usually used after 2 to 3 days from injury in order to increase lymphatic action, improve the general circulation and continue the healing process. With minor trauma, muscle  strains,  menstrual  cramps  etc.,  heat  or  cold  can  be  applied  in  approximately  20  minute  intervals  as  an  initial measure. If these treatments are required longer than the 2 to 3 day timeframe, as mentioned above, a doctor's order will be required to continue treatment.\n\n## Aspirin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough aspirin is approved for use in children over the age of two, aspirin should not be administered to a child with a suspected viral illness due to aspirin's association with Reye's Syndrome. Aspirin will only be administered by a campus nurse when provided a physician's written order.\n\n## Narcotic Drugs\n\nPain relievers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen may be administered by the campus nurse following Leander ISD's protocols.  Narcotic  drugs  will  not be administered by the campus nurse. If a child is experiencing pain that requires the use of narcotic drugs during the school day, the child should remain at home.\n\n## Off-Campus Event/Club Chaperone Training\n\nOff-Campus Event Chaperone Training is required for any chaperone that will be responsible for collecting and securing medications,  and  maintaining  protected  health  information  during  an  off-campus  event.  Training  will  be  valid  for  the current  school  year  only.  Volunteers  seeking  opportunities  to  serve  as  a  medication  chaperone  during  an  off-campus event,  will  be  required  to attend additional training and clearance from the Director of Health Services. To inquire about training, please refer to the volunteer webpage.\n\nOff-Campus  Event is defined as any school sponsored event/club taking place on or off campus, after regular school hours  or  overnight  trips.  Examples  of  a  school  sponsored  event/club  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  Destination Imagination, Robotics, Band, Dance, Student Council. Field trips taking place during regular school hours do not fall into this category.\n\n## Head Lice\n\nHead  lice  are  one  of  the  nuisances  that  parents  of  school-age  students  occasionally  find  themselves  dealing  with. Leander ISD follows the Department of State Health Services recommendations. Individual head checks are performed on an as needed basis. Mass screenings will not be conducted. Parents are encouraged to periodically check their student's head  for  lice.  When  live  lice  are  discovered  at  school  the  parent  or  guardian  will  be  contacted  to  treat  their  student. Contact the school clinic or visit TDSHS Website for additional information.\n\n## Immunization Requirements\n\nThe  school's  clinic  personnel  can  provide  information  on  state  immunization  requirements  or  you  can  find  a  list  of  all required  immunizations  by  accessing  the  TXDSHS  Immunization  Unit.  A  student  shall  show  acceptable  evidence  of vaccination  prior  to  entry,  attendance,  or  transfer  to  a  child-care  facility  or  public  or  private  elementary  or  secondary school. (Rule §97.61-97.69 29 Tex Reg 3188 - adopted effective April 1, 2004)\n\nAcceptable evidence of documentation includes records with the signature or stamp of the physician/designee, and or public  health  personnel;  official  record  from  state  or  local  health  authority;  or  record  received  from  school  officials.  All vaccines shall include the month, day, and year each vaccine was administered.\n\nExemptions :  The  law allows (a) physicians to write a statement stating that the vaccine(s) required would be medically harmful  or  injurious  to  the  health  and  well-being  of  the  child,  and  (b)  parents/guardians  to  choose  an  exemption  from immunization requirements for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief. The law does not allow parents/guardians to elect an exemption simply because of inconvenience (for example, a record is lost or incomplete and it is too much trouble to go to a physician or clinic to correct the problem). Up-to-date list of students with exemptions will be kept, as they may be excluded from school in times of emergency or epidemic declared\n\nInstructions  for  requesting  the  official  exemption  affidavit  that  must  be  signed  by  parents/guardians  choosing  the exemption for reasons of conscience, including a religious belief, can be found at TXDSHS Immunization Unit webpage. Only  completed,  original  notarized  form  will  be  accepted  as  proof  of  conscientious/religious  exemption.  Religious  and conscientious exemptions will be valid for only two years.\n\nMedical exemptions must be signed by an MD or DO that is licensed to practice in the U.S. In the statement, it must state that the vaccine required is medically harmful or injurious to the health and well-being of the child. Unless it is written in the statement that a lifelong condition exists, the exemption is only valid for one year from the date the physician signed it.\n\nProvisional Enrollment : The law requires that students be fully vaccinated against the specified diseases. A student may be enrolled  provisionally  if  the  student  has  an immunization record that indicates the student has received at least one dose  of  each  specified  age-appropriate  vaccine  required  by  this  rule  and  is  currently  on  track  with  the  series  of immunizations. To remain enrolled, the student must complete the required subsequent doses in each vaccine series on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nschedule  and  as  rapidly  as  is  medically  feasible  and  provide  acceptable  evidence  of  the  vaccination  to  the  school.  A school nurse, clinic personnel, or school administrator (or designee) shall review the immunization status of a provisionally enrolled student at least every 30 days to ensure continued compliance in completing the required doses of vaccination. If, at the end of the period, a student has not received a subsequent dose of vaccine, the student is not in compliance and the  school shall exclude the student from attendance until the required dose is administered (and proof of immunization brought to  the  school.)  A  student  can  be  enrolled  provisionally  for  no  more  than  30  days  if  she/he transfers from one Texas school to another and is awaiting the transfer of immunization records.\n\nStudents who are not current with immunizations will be excluded from school until their immunizations are current as per state  law  (Rule §97.61-97.69 29 Tex Reg 3188). One (1) day of absence will be excused to allow the family time to get necessary  immunizations.  Each  day  of  absence  thereafter  will  be  an  unexcused  absence.  Unexcused  absences  are reported to the proper authorities and may result in judicial proceedings.\n\nWhen your student is due for an immunization, an immunization due letter will be emailed and/or mailed. Immunization record  copies  are  no  longer  available  in  the  clinic.  To  obtain  a  copy  of  your  child's  immunization  record, please email student.records@leanderisd.org\n\n## Vision and Hearing Screening\n\nIn accordance with the Texas Department of State Health Services, vision and hearing screening exams are performed. TDSHS Vision and Hearing When a student's initial enrollment in Leander ISD is also the student's initial enrollment in any Texas school, the student shall  be  screened  for  possible  vision  and  hearing  problems.  The  student or minor student's parent,  managing conservator, or guardian, may elect to substitute one (1) or more professional examinations for the required  screening  tests.  Students  in  kindergarten  and  grades  pre-k,  1,  3,  5,  and  7,  shall  be  screened  for  vision  and hearing problems.\n\nA student is  exempt  from  the  screening  requirements  if  the  tests  conflict with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination of which the student is an adherent or a member. The student or minor student's parent, managing conservator, or guardian shall submit to the clinic on or before the day of admission an affidavit stating the objections to screening.\n\n## Spinal Screening\n\nSpinal screenings are done in accordance with the Texas Department of State Health Services. This requirement may be met  by  a  professional  examination  performed  by  a  state-licensed  practitioner  with  expertise  in  diagnosing  spinal deformities.  A  student  is  exempt  from  the  screening requirements if the tests conflict with the tenets and practices of a recognized  church  or  religious  denomination  of  which  the  student  is  an  adherent  or  a  member.  The  student  or  minor student's  parent,  managing  conservator,  or  guardian  shall  submit  to  the  clinic  on  or  before  the  day  of  admission  an affidavit stating the objections to screening. Health and Safety Code 36.005(b), 37.002(b)\n\nA student is  exempt  from  the  screening  requirements  if  the  tests  conflict with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination of which the student is an adherent or a member. The student or minor student's parent, managing conservator, or guardian shall submit to the clinic on or before the day of admission an affidavit stating the objections to screening. Health and Safety Code 36.005(b), 37.002(b)\n\nIf  the  spinal  screening  indicates  the  student  may  have  an  abnormal spinal curvature, the nurse or clinic assistant shall send the original  of  the  screening  report  to  the  student's  parent, managing conservator, or guardian along with a letter advising of the parent's responsibility to select an appropriate health practitioner for an examination. 25 TAC 37.148 (e)\n\n## Acanthosis Nigricans Screening\n\nThe law requires Acanthosis Nigricans screening of students in grades 1, 3, 5, and 7. 'Acanthosis Nigricans' means a light  brown  or  black  velvety,  rough,  or  thickened  area  on  the  surface  of  the  skin  that  may  signal  high  insulin  levels indicative  of  insulin  resistance.  This  screening  will  be  performed  at  the  same  time  hearing/vision  screening  or  spinal screening is  performed.  If  the  screening  indicates  the  student  meets  state  specified  criteria,  a letter will be sent to the student's parent, managing conservator, or guardian advising of their responsibility to select an appropriate practitioner for an examination. For questions about Acanthosis Nigricans, you may go to the TDSHS Website.\n\n## Bacterial Meningitis\n\nSenate Bill  31  requires  public  schools  to  annually provide all students and parents with information relating to bacterial meningitis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SAFETY\n\n## Standard Response Protocol (SRP): Evacuate, Shelter, Lockdown, Secure\n\nLISD has adopted SRP for emergency response and training, endorsed by the Texas School Safety Center (TXSSC) and supported by partnerships with local law enforcement and emergency services. During the school year students and staff are trained on SRP and will take part in emergency drills as mandated by the state. It is very important that the students follow  the  teacher's  instructions.  Classes  will  not be dismissed unless authorized by the District administrators. Parents and guardians are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the SRP protocols, which are accessible online and through our school's safety resources.\n\n## Security Cameras\n\nTo  enhance  safety  and  security  within  our  schools,  the  district  has  strategically  placed  security  cameras  at  all  school locations.  For  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  our  security  measures,  the  specific  locations  of  security  cameras  are considered  confidential.  The  district  maintains  strict  policies  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  camera  locations  are  not disclosed publicly. This confidentiality helps to prevent tampering and misuse of the security system.\n\n## Pesticides Notice\n\nThe  District  periodically  applies  pesticides.  Information  concerning  these  applications  may  be  obtained  from  the  LISD Plant Services Department at 512-570-0637. The schedule for pesticide application is posted in the campus office.\n\n## Asbestos\n\nLISD strives  to  comply with all mandated Federal and State laws governing asbestos in school buildings. A copy of the Asbestos Management Plan can be found in the clinic office at each campus. If you have any questions or would like to examine  the  district's  Asbestos  Management  Plan  in  more  detail,  please  contact  the  district's  Asbestos  Designated Person in Risk Management at 512-570-0136.\n\n## Non-Service Animals on Campus\n\nOnly  animals  approved  by  the  campus  administrator  can  be  allowed  on  campus  for  curriculum  purposes.  Safety  for students and staff will be a primary factor in the approval and decision process.\n\n## Service Animals on Campus\n\nService Animals are allowed on campus in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. An employee or student who wishes to bring a service animal to campus must seek approval by the campus administrator, in consultation with Angela Patrick, Section 504/ADA Coordinator (student) or Lisa Gibbs (employee). The use of a service animal must follow District  guidelines  always.  See  Board  Policy  FBA  (Legal),  FBA  (Regulation).  Visitors  with  service  animals  should  be allowed access in accordance with law.\n\n## Visitor Management System (Raptor)\n\nTo  ensure  the  safety  of  our  students, staff, and visitors, LISD has implemented the Raptor visitor management system. The Raptor system enables campuses to track and verify visitors against a national public sex offender database. Any visitor  requesting  to  go  beyond  the  front office must provide a state-issued driver's license or government-issued photo identification. Identification will be scanned using the Raptor system to generate a temporary badge that includes a photo. Please  note  that  this  process  is  solely  intended  to  screen  against  the  sex  offender  database  and  does  not  involve  a criminal background check. No additional personal information is accessed, collected, or retained.\n\n## Walking to and from School\n\nIf students are walking to and from school, it is important to obey traffic safety rules and signals. Students must follow the guidance and directions of safety patrols/crossing guards to ensure their safety. Children should discuss with their parents the  best  route  to  take  to  and  from  school.  Practice  traveling  the  route  and  watching  the  time  is  encouraged,  so  that children will know when to leave home to arrive at school on time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt  is  also  encouraged  that  students  walk  with  a  buddy  or  in  groups,  especially  in  less  populated  or  poorly  lit  areas. Students  should  dress  appropriately  for  the  weather  conditions  (e.g.,  wearing  a  jacket  on  cold  days  or  carrying  an umbrella on rainy days).\n\nIt is  encouraged  for  parents  to  provide  guidance  to  their  students  on  what  to  do  in  case  of  emergencies,  such  as encountering  a  stranger  or  feeling  unsafe.  Encourage  students  to  know  where  safe  places  are  along  their  route  (like trusted neighbors' homes or businesses). It is also discouraged for students to use headphones or electronic devices that could distract them from paying attention to their surroundings.\n\n## Bicycles\n\nIf  a  student  rides  a  bike  to  school in the street, he/she must obey the same traffic rules that apply to automobiles. The student  should  ride  in  single  file  WITH  the  traffic, stop for lights, signal for turns, give pedestrians the right of way, and watch out for  his/her  safety  and  the  safety  of  others. Students should walk bikes across the crosswalks and on school property. Students should discuss with their parents the best route to take to and from school. Practice traveling the route and watching the time is encouraged, so that they know when to leave home to arrive at school on time. Students are asked to secure bikes with a lock. The school cannot be held responsible for lost or stolen bikes.\n\n## Voluntary Student Accident Insurance\n\nThe  district  offers  several  voluntary  low-cost  student  insurance  plans  for  parents  or  guardians  who  wish  to  purchase coverage for their children. It is available online through K-12 Student InsurancePlans  (Flyer: English | Spanish ). For more information, please call 1-800-367-5830.\n\nPublic  school  districts  are  immune  for  bodily  injury  to  students  and  the  public  (except  for  limited  liability  for  negligent operation and use of a motorized vehicle) as provided in the Texas Tort Claims Act, section 101.001 et seq. of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code.\n\n## Unsupervised Students\n\nParents should be aware that there is no adult supervision for students arriving prior  to  the  first  bus  each morning or remaining on campus after dismissal time each evening.\n\nParents are encouraged to ask campus administrators what areas are designated as waiting areas for students who arrive early or must stay late. These areas are well-lit and monitored for security. Students should wait in these designated areas and avoid secluded or isolated places on campus.\n\n## Trips Outside the District\n\nBefore students are allowed to travel outside the District on school-sanctioned trips, parents or legal guardians must sign and return the appropriate permission form. This form acknowledges parental consent for their child to participate in the trip and affirms understanding of the trip's details, including itinerary, supervision, safety measures and student and parent expectations.\n\nStudents without a signed permission form will not be permitted to participate in the trip.\n\n## TRANSPORTATION\n\nThe LISD Transportation Department is committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of each student. In the interest of safety, students are expected to behave on the school buses and at bus stops just as they do at school. All school rules of conduct  apply  to  students  while  they  are  being  provided  transportation.  Riding  in  a  District  transportation  vehicle  is  a PRIVILEGE offered to eligible students who reside within the district. Procedures and safety rules, combined with campus standards of conduct, help ensure the safety and protection of each student. Failure to meet these standards or follow these safety rules and procedures may result in student conflicts or injuries and also cause delays or distractions to the driver.  Those  students  who  consistently  fail  to  abide  by  these  rules,  procedures,  and  standards  may  lose  their  riding privilege to ride any LISD bus for a period of time determined by each individual school.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrivers of school passenger transportation vehicles are responsible for the safe operation of their vehicles. They have the authority  to  enforce  the  rules  and  procedures  and  also  give  directions  to  students  concerning  standards  of  conduct. Seating is determined by each driver and may be divided into sections according to campus. Assigned seats within any section are required by the Transportation Department.\n\nFor safety reasons, animals or other living things, glass containers, large band instruments, and any other object that, due to  its  size, would obstruct an aisle or emergency exit, prevent correct student seating, or obstruct the driver's views are not allowed on the bus. To the extent possible, band instruments or athletic equipment will be in the seat with the student. If  items  carried  on  the  bus cannot safely ride in the student's seat it will not be allowed on the bus. Telecommunication devices may be used on the school bus, by the owner only, if their use does not create problems. Headphones must be used if audio is in use on the telecommunication device. Students are not permitted to use external audio devices such as Bluetooth speakers. The displaying or taking of photos, with devices so equipped, is not permitted. Refer to Student Code of Conduct for other prohibited items.\n\n## Discipline and Student Management\n\n## Overview - Students are expected to:\n\n- ● Abide by all procedures and rules including those set forth by LISD Student Code of Conduct.\n- ● Respect district property.\n- ● Avoid physically or emotionally harming themselves or others.\n- ● Refrain from any behavior that distracts the driver.\n- ● Note the more in-depth discussion for the conduct of students riding Leander ISD transportation vehicles that is found in the 'Student Bus Rider Handbook', a separate document distributed to all bus riders at the beginning of the school year. Note that a portion of the handbook is to be detached and returned to the bus driver, acknowledging the receipt and understanding of the handbook's information by the student and the parent/guardian.\n\nStudents will be held accountable for their own behavior. Please report any concerns to your driver immediately so they can help resolve the situation.\n\n## Discipline Management Techniques\n\nDiscipline shall be designed to improve conduct and to encourage students to adhere to their responsibilities as members of the school community. Disciplinary action shall draw on the professional judgment of teachers and administrators and on a range of discipline  management techniques. Discipline shall be correlated to the seriousness of the offense, the student's  age  and  grade  level,  the  frequency  of  misbehavior,  the student's attitude, the effect of the misconduct on the school environment, and statutory requirements.\n\nBecause of these factors, discipline for a particular offense, including misconduct in a District vehicle owned or operated by the District, unless otherwise specified by law, may bring into consideration varying techniques and responses. Since the Districts primary responsibility in transporting students in District vehicles is to do so as safely as possible, the operator  of  the  vehicle  must  focus  on  driving  and  not  have  his  or  her  attention  distracted  by  student  misbehavior. Therefore,  when  appropriate  disciplinary  management  techniques  fail  to  improve  student  behavior  or  when  specific misconduct  warrants  immediate  removal,  the  principal  may  restrict  or  revoke  a  student's  transportation  privileges,  in accordance with law.\n\nThe  District  shall  provide  transportation  to  the  DAEP  for  students  in  a  Disciplinary  Alternative  Education  Program. However, if a student placed in the DAEP violates District transportation rules, the student may be denied transportation provided by the District.\n\nA bus driver may refer a student to the principal's office to maintain effective discipline on the bus by submitting a student conduct report (SCR). The principal must employ additional discipline management techniques, as appropriate, which can include restricting or revoking a student's bus riding privileges.\n\n## Safety Rules and Procedures\n\n## LISD Bus Safety Rules:\n\n- ● Stay seated in your assigned seat.\n- ● If the bus is equipped with seat belts, by law, they must be worn.\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● You must have your Smart Tag badge to access the bus both morning and afternoon.\n- ● Keep your whole body inside the bus.\n- ● Do not throw anything from the bus.\n- ● Get on and off only at your assigned stop.\n- ● No pushing, shoving, fighting, shouting, or inappropriate language.\n- ● No eating, drinking, smoking, spitting, destruction of property, or possession of harmful objects.\n- ● PLAIN, UNFLAVORED, UNSWEETENED, DRINKING WATER IN PLASTIC CONTAINERS IS THE ONLY LIQUID OR FOOD ALLOWED.\n- ● Do not bother other students or their belongings.\n- ● Be respectful to others and transportation staff. Their job is to keep you safe.\n\n## While waiting to load - to avoid injury:\n\n- ● Arrive at the stop 5 minutes earlier than the scheduled loading time. Remain out of the street and don't create a problem for the owner of the property where the stop is located.\n- ● When the bus approaches, stay away from the curb and the front wheel of the bus. Wait until the bus has come to a complete stop, and wait for the driver's signal to cross/board.\n- ● Board carefully and use the handrail. Be courteous and do not push or shove. Scan your smart card and move directly to your assigned seat.\n\n## While riding:\n\n- ● Remain completely seated, facing forward, with all body parts inside the bus, backpack in lap, and arms, feet, and torso out of aisle. Standing or moving from seat to seat is not allowed.\n- ● As required by law, should the bus be equipped with three-point seatbelts, all students on board are required to use the seat belt.\n- ● Respect the rights of other students. Do not violate their space, nor physically or emotionally harm them.\n- ● Do not participate in any event, which causes the driver to be distracted from driving.\n- ● Never allow baggage to block an exit window, door, or any part of the aisle. In an emergency, no time is available to clear the path to safety.\n\n## While unloading:\n\n- ● As the vehicle approaches your stop, gather your belongings, but remain seated until the vehicle has come to a complete stop.\n- ● Move to the door quickly so other traffic will not be delayed. Scan your smart card and use the handrail while descending the stairs.\n- ● Step down to the ground carefully and walk directly away from the vehicle at least two steps before turning left or right. Never walk alongside the vehicle or anywhere within 3 feet of the rear tires. If you must cross the street, move at least 15 feet in front of the vehicle and wait for the driver's signal to cautiously move into the roadway, stopping directly in front of the driver's side of the bus. You will check left-right- left yourself and wait for the driver's second signal to cross the remainder of the roadway.\n\n## Discipline:\n\n- ● Drivers will make on-the-spot corrections and may assign specific seating to students who are misbehaving. When students do not respond to the driver's initial efforts to correct misbehavior, a formal Student Conduct Report will be given to the campus administration. Campus administration will address the student misbehavior using any of the techniques outlined in the LISD Student Code of Conduct. Student discipline management procedures will consider the severity of the offense, the maturity of the student, and the student's past conduct on the bus.\n\n## Changing Routes, Stops\n\nStudents who want to go to a destination other than their regular destination must obtain a rider Permit from the campus office. To obtain a permit, parents may send a note to school, phone, or request in person. The student will then give the permit  to  the  driver  who  will  retain  the permit and will deliver the student to the requested regular stop. Bus passes for students  going  home  with  regular riders will be honored only if there are seats available on the bus. Bus drivers do not have the authority to allow students to ride without a rider permit.\n\nParents or others may not remove a student from the bus without permission and may not, by law, board the bus at any time.  To  ensure  the  safety  of  our  students,  in  order  to  remove  a  student already on the bus, parents must contact the campus administrator for clearance. Identification may be requested prior to the student being removed from the bus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bus Information\n\nStudents wishing to ride a bus different from their regular bus must obtain a permit from the front office prior to the last bell of  the  school  day.  Requests  must  come  from  a  parent  or  guardian  only  and  must  contain  parent  contact  information, date(s) of bus changes and student ID.\n\n## Notice to Bus Riders\n\nAll  students  who  ride  school  transportation  vehicles  are  prohibited  from  loitering  in  the  parking lots before and/or after school.\n\n## Extracurricular Trips\n\nSchool  trips  will  be  arranged  through  the  office.  A  sponsor  will  be  on  each  vehicle.  Students  may  not  be  released  to friends  or  any  person  except  the  sponsor  or  student's parent unless prior arrangements have been made with campus personnel prior to the trip. While the driver is responsible for the overall safety of each student, the sponsor is responsible for the management of the students while at the event or en route. Students should contact their sponsor for details of the trip.\n\n## Video Cameras\n\nVideo camera recording of the ride has proven to be a valuable tool in maintaining safe student conduct. In the event that an incident  occurs,  video  footage  will  be  retained, and segments may be provided to the campus administrator. Due to legal  reasons,  the  data  on  the  video  is  considered  confidential  information  and,  as a matter of privacy, is not released outside the campus/department without the appropriate legal document.\n\n## Shuttle Service\n\nIn order to improve the timeliness of service, some routes will include a short shuttle to or from some campuses. Routes selected for shuttle will take advantage of the time differences between secondary and elementary bell times.\n\n## Crossing Guards\n\nCrossing guards are provided at the elementary and middle schools at designated streets and intersections. To ensure a safe  route  to  school,  students  must  obey  all  procedures  and  rules  provided  by  crossing  guards  at  all  crosswalks  and intersections.\n\n## Student Drivers\n\nStudents who drive vehicles to school are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n- ● Student drivers must be in high school (9 th - 12 th grade) in order to drive on campus and use the school's parking lot facilities.\n- ● Student drivers are expected to follow all of the specified guidelines for those parking on school property. Please refer to each school's set of expectations for parking on campus.\n- ● Student drivers should understand that their vehicles are subject to periodic drug dog searches.\n- ● Student drivers are expected to visibly display the school's proper vehicle identification tag.\n\n## STUDENT ACTIVITIES\n\n## Extracurricular Activities\n\n(High School Only)\n\nAcademic/Behavior Standards\n\nParticipating in extracurricular activities and  representing  the District in University Interscholastic League  (UIL) competitions is a privilege afforded to students. As with any privilege, there are responsibilities that students must uphold. A student will be permitted to participate in extracurricular activities subject to the following restrictions:\n\n- ● A student who receives, at the end of any grade evaluation period, an average grade below 70 in any academic class other than an identified honors or advanced class, or a student with disabilities who fails to meet the standards in the Individual Education Plan (IEP) may not participate in extracurricular activities for at least three (3) school weeks. An ineligible student may practice or rehearse while suspended. The student regains eligibility when the principal and teachers determine that he or she has: (1) earned a passing grade (70 or above) in all academic classes other than those that are honors or advanced; and (2) has completed at least three school weeks of ineligibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● The District shall permit students to be absent for extracurricular activities in accordance with State Board rules. When a student has accumulated ten (10) absences for extracurricular activities, additional absences must be approved by the principal.\n- ● Any disciplinary behavior-related restrictions on participation are set out in the Student Code of Conduct.\n\nA student who misses class because of participation in an activity sponsored by a non-approved organization will receive an unexcused absence.\n\nSuspension of a student with a disability  that  significantly  interferes  with the student's ability to meet regular academic standards must be based on the student's individualized education program. The determination of whether a disability significantly  interferes  with  a  student's  ability  to  meet  regular  academic  standards  must  be  made  by  the  student's admission, review, and dismissal committee. For purposes of this section, \"student with disability\" means a student who is eligible for a district's special education program . A student may not participate in extracurricular activities if that student is placed on Home-Based Instruction, suspended, in a DAEP, or expelled.\n\n## Rules for Participation in Extracurricular Activities\n\nCertain  activities,  elected  offices,  student clubs, performing groups such as band and choir, and drill and athletic teams have established rules and consequences for misbehavior that are stricter than those for students in general. If a violation of those rules is also a violation of school rules, the consequences specified by the school shall apply, in addition to any consequences  specified  by  the  organization.  Each  organization's  rules  for  participation  will  be  distributed  to  all participants.\n\n## University Interscholastic League (UIL) Activities (Secondary Only)\n\nThe  majority  of  extracurricular  activities  are  governed  by  the  Constitution  and  Rules  of  the  University  Interscholastic League.  These  UIL  activities  include  literary  events  (e.g.,  debate,  informative  speaking,  poetry  interpretation,  prose reading, science, ready-writing, spelling and plain writing, number sense, calculator applications, one-act play, music contests  (band  and  choir  events);  and  athletic  contests  (football,  volleyball,  basketball,  tennis,  golf,  track,  baseball, swimming/diving,  wrestling,  softball,  soccer  and  cross  country).  All  students  are  encouraged  to  participate  in  the  UIL events. The rules set forth will be strictly enforced during the year.\n\n## Organizations/Clubs\n\nEach campus has a wide variety of organizations and clubs available for enrolled student to become involved in during the school  year.  We  encourage  you  to  check  in  the  assistant  principal  and  counselors'  offices  to  confirm  availability  of organizations/clubs for your specific campus. If a student would like to request starting a new club, they must get the New Club Request form from the assistant principals' office and follow the steps outlined.\n\n## Social Activities\n\nSocial  activities,  such  as  dances,  parties,  etc.,  sponsored  by  the  school  must  be  held  on  the  school  campus  unless otherwise approved by the principal. Students who desire to bring a friend to a school dance who is not a member of the student body of a Leander ISD high school must obtain a visitor's pass from an administrator at least 24 hours prior to the function.  Middle  school students are not allowed to attend high school dances. Anyone 21 years old or older will not be allowed  to  attend  dances  on  a  campus  unless  enrolled  there.  Additionally,  anyone  21  years  old  or  older  will  not  be permitted to attend the prom dance unless currently enrolled on an LISD High School campus.\n\nThe rules of good conduct shall be observed for school social events by students and their friends. The person inviting the guest shall share responsibility for the conduct of their guest. Participation in social activities is at the discretion of campus administration.\n\n## School Publications\n\nThe yearbook is published by the yearbook staff under the supervision of the yearbook sponsor. Orders for yearbooks are taken each year. The campus newspaper published by the journalism class is also available to the student body.\n\n## Posters\n\nSigns and posters that students wish to display must first be approved by the campus administrator. Posters displayed without  authorization  will  be  removed.  Students  must  remove  posters  and  adhesives  within  twenty-four  (24)  hours  of event(s). Posters should not be taped to painted surfaces.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Distribution of Printed Material\n\nAll  aspects of school-sponsored newspapers and/or yearbooks are completely under the supervision of the teacher and campus principal. Written  materials,  handbills,  photographs,  pictures,  petitions,  films,  tapes,  or  other  visual  or auditory materials  may  not  be  sold,  circulated,  or  distributed  on  any  school  campus  by  a  student  or  a  non-student  without the approval of the principal and in accordance with campus regulations.\n\nAll such material over which the district does not exercise editorial control that is intended for distribution to students shall be submitted to the principal for review and approval. If the material is not approved within twenty-four (24) hours of the time  that  it  was  submitted,  it must be considered disapproved. Any student who sells, circulates or distributes any nonapproved materials will be disciplined in accordance with the Student Code of Conduct.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n## Bullying\n\nThe district strives to prevent bullying, in accordance with the district's policies, by promoting a respectful school climate; encouraging  reporting  of  bullying  incidents,  including  anonymous  reporting;  and  investigating  and  addressing  reported bullying incidents.\n\nBullying is defined in state law as a single significant act or a pattern of acts by one or more students directed at another student  that  exploits  an  imbalance  of  power  and  involves  engaging in written or verbal expression, expression through electronic means, or physical conduct that:\n\n- ● Has the effect or will have the effect of physically harming a student, damaging a student's property, or placing a student in reasonable fear of harm to the student's person or of damage to the student's property;\n- ● Is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive enough that the action or threat creates an intimidating, threatening, or abusive educational environment for a student;\n- ● Materially and substantially disrupts the educational process or the orderly operation of a classroom or school; or\n- ● Infringes on the rights of the victim at school. Bullying includes cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined in state law as bullying that is done through the use of any electronic communication device, including through the use of:\n- ● A cellular or other type of telephone\n- ● A computer\n- ● A camera\n- ● Electronic mail\n- ● Instant messaging\n- ● Text messaging\n- ● A social media application\n- ● An internet website\n- ● Any other internet-based communication tool.\n\nBullying is prohibited by the district and could include:\n\n- ● Hazing\n- ● Threats\n- ● Taunting\n- ● Teasing\n- ● Confinement\n- ● Assault\n- ● Demands for money\n- ● Destruction of property\n- ● Theft of valued possessions\n- ● Name-calling\n- ● Rumor-spreading\n- ● Ostracism\n\nIf a student believes that he or she has experienced bullying or witnesses the bullying of another student, the student or parent  should  notify  a  teacher,  school  counselor,  principal,  or another district employee as soon as possible. A student may anonymously report an alleged incidence of bullying by going to: https://www.anonymousalerts.com/leanderisd/ The administration will investigate any allegations of bullying and related misconduct. The district will also provide notice to the parent of the alleged victim and the parent of the student alleged to have engaged in bullying.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Change of Address or Telephone Number\n\nUp-to-date information is essential for the school to successfully handle emergencies and to maintain communication with parents.  Therefore,  the  Registrar's  Office  should  be  notified  immediately  of  a  change  of  home,  work  or  emergency telephone numbers. If you have changed your address, you must provide proof of residency and proof of identity to the school.\n\nLeander ISD uses PowerSchool Registration to update information on students returning to our schools each year. By replacing  previous  paper  practices  with  an  online  process,  the  district  is  reducing  paper  waste,  improving  accuracy, increasing efficiency and saving parents' time.\n\n## Check Policy\n\nChecks written to the school or any school organization must include on the front of the check the driver's license number and a valid telephone number. Post-dated and temporary checks are not accepted.\n\nIn  the  event  that  a  check  written  to  any  Leander  ISD  campus,  club,  or  organization  is  returned unpaid by a bank, the check will be forwarded to a third-party vendor for collection. The amount of the check plus a return check fee of $30.00 will be collected by such third party. Once the check has been sent to the third-party vendor, any issues faced by the check issuer will need to be addressed with such vendor. The $30.00 check fee is in addition to any fees your bank may charge. The use of a check for payment is your ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE of this policy and its terms.\n\n## Conduct Before and After School\n\n## (Secondary Only)\n\nTeachers  and  administrators  have  full  authority  over  student  conduct  during  activities  held  before  or  after  school  on District premises, such as play rehearsal, club meetings, athletic practice, and special study groups or tutorials. Students are  subject  to  the  same  rules  of  conduct  that  apply  during  the  instructional  day  and  will  be  subject  to  consequences established by the Student Code of Conduct or any additional applicable expectations established by the sponsor.\n\n## Consent\n\nBy acknowledging receipt of the Student Handbook, Student Code of Conduct, and Technology Resource Acceptable Use Guidelines,  guardians  are  giving  consent  for  their  student  to  use  their  LISD  Google  Suite  for  Education  account  and related  services.  A  detailed  explanation  for  computer  use  is  required  reading.  See  Appendix  A  for  Acceptable  Use Guidelines.\n\n## Counseling Services\n\nOur school counselor is here to help students. Using the framework of the American School Counselor Association the school counselor conducts counseling lessons and activities, helps students with organization and study skills, and serves as an advocate for students. A student may ask to see the counselor, or the parent/guardian, or teacher may also request that the counselor visit with the child.\n\nLicensed Professional Counselors and Licensed Clinical Social Workers are available to assist students with short-term counseling. Their services may be accessed by receiving a referral from the school counselor.\n\n## Suicide Prevention and Early Mental Health Intervention\n\nLeander  ISD  promotes  the  prevention  of  suicide  through  the  Comprehensive  Guidance  Curriculum  and  through  the support  for  campus  activities  and  groups,  such  as  No  Place  for  Hate,  that  promote  the  well-being  of  our  students. Faculties  are  provided  access  annual  training  to recognize signs in student that may indicate the need for early mental health intervention. The campus counselor is the liaison for identified students. A student who is referred to a counselor following  a  report  of  suicidal  ideation  is  screened  by  the  counselor  with  a  non-medical assessment instrument. Parent contact is made following the screening of any student. Parent involvement is required for any further interventions, which may include contact with the Mobile Crisis Outreach Team.\n\n## Damage to School Property\n\nEach  one of us is  proud  of  our  school  buildings,  furniture,  and  buses.  Should  a  student  damage  school  property,  the student and parents can be responsible for paying for the cost of replacement or repair of the damage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delayed Opening/Early Dismissal of School Due to Inclement Weather\n\nOn occasions of possible hazardous road conditions, Leander ISD Transportation Dept. staff and local law enforcement will  continuously  monitor  and  assess  area  roads.  The  superintendent  will decide whether to delay school starting time, cancel school, dismiss classes, or proceed as usual with school. Information about school closings, delays, or dismissals will  be  announced  on  the  district  website  and  social  media,  the  Leander  ISD  \"Remind\"  messaging  system  (including phone calls, emails, and text messages as appropriate) and on local radio and television stations.\n\nQuestions  should  be  directed  to  the  LISD  Transportation  Dept.  after  6  a.m.  at  512-570-0700.  In  the  event  school  is dismissed during the day, parents may pick students up at the main office if they so desire. Parents must notify the school office and sign the appropriate forms before students may be taken from campus.\n\n## Donations\n\nDonations for students'  negative  meal  account  balances may be made online via edPay. Once donation balances for a specific school reach $200.00, all negative accounts at that campus will be adjusted. If the balance is enough to cover all the negative debt for the specific campus, all negative debt will be removed. If there is not enough in the donation balance to  remove  all  negative  debt  at a specific campus, the funds will be distributed equally among all negative students. We may not accept cash donations nor transfer funds from a student's account into a donation account.\n\n## Elevator Keys\n\nProcedures for securing elevator keys will  vary  among  schools.  Please  check  with  the  office  personnel  for  the  proper procedures in securing elevator keys.\n\n## Enrollment Procedures\n\nThe law requires that a school district  record  the  name  and  address  of  the  person  enrolling  a  child.  In  order to avoid disruptions  to  students  in  classes,  new  students  are  urged  to  enroll  before  the school day begins. The following items need to be submitted on the day of enrollment:\n\n- 1. A complete immunization record.\n- 2. The law requires identification of each public-school student by the student's legal surname as it appears on the student's birth certificate or suitable proof of identity, or in a court order changing the student's name.\n- 3. A copy of the driver's license or some type of photo ID of the person enrolling the student.\n- 4. Student records from the previous school and official withdrawal paperwork.\n- 5.

Students  are required to remain in the area where their activity is scheduled to take place. Unless the teacher or sponsor overseeing the activity gives permission, a student will not be permitted to go to another area of the building or campus.\n\nAfter dismissal from school in the afternoon, and unless involved in an activity under the supervision of a teacher, students must leave campus immediately.\n\n## Fees\n\nStudent Fees\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEducation  for  students  of  the  Leander  Independent  School  District  shall  be  free  and  no  student  shall  be  denied  this education because of inability to furnish the necessary educational supplies. Fees or deposits required of students will be held  to a minimum and only as permitted by law. Students are expected to provide their own supplies of pencils, paper, erasers and notebooks and may be required to pay certain other fees or deposits, including:\n\n- 1. Club dues,\n- 2.

An electronic Fundraiser Request form (found on the Leander ISD website under Booster Clubs) must be submitted to request permission to conduct the fundraiser and the fundraiser must be approved before it begins. Except as approved by the principal, fundraising is not permitted on school property.\n\n## (Secondary Only)\n\nCampuses,  Classes,  Student  clubs,  PTSA's,  Booster  Clubs,  and  outside  organizations  will  be  allowed  to  conduct fundraising events if the event is approved beforehand. An electronic Fundraiser Request form (found on the Leander ISD website under Booster Clubs) must be submitted to request permission to conduct the fundraiser and the fundraiser must be approved before it begins. Except as approved by the principal, fundraising is not permitted on school property.\n\n## Waiver of Fees\n\nA deposit or fee, that a student and his or her parent or guardian are unable to pay, may be waived. Procedures for waiver of fees or deposits shall be posted in a central location in each school and shall be included in the District's policy manual and student handbooks.\n\nUpon receipt of reliable proof that a student and his/her parents or guardian are unable to pay a deposit or fee required by the school, the deposit or fee shall be waived. The student and his/her parents should present evidence to the principal of their inability to pay. The principal will decide upon the eligibility for the waiver.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Students\n\n## (High School Only)\n\nThe Austin area has very active and involved foreign exchange groups. Leander ISD's students and families benefit by the rich exposure of the many different cultures brought by foreign exchange students.\n\nAs parents (families)  are  processing  the  possibilities  of hosting a foreign exchange student, it is important to know that LISD has obtained a waiver from the Texas Education Agency (TEA) which on a yearly basis limits the number of foreign exchange students to five (5) per high school. The current waiver is good through the 2023-2024 school year.\n\nIt is advisable to check with the LISD contact person to determine whether or not slots are available before making final decisions in regard to hosting a foreign exchange student.\n\nFor more information, contact Laura Lewis at 512-570-0227.\n\n## Google Workspace for Education\n\nLISD will create accounts for all students to allow for collaborative sharing using Google Workspace for Education. These tools  are  housed  on  the  Internet  and  can  be  accessed  from  any  Internet-connected  device.  No  special  software  is required. Google Workspace for Education is a set of online tools for communication, collaboration and document storage. Provided  by  Google  to  LISD  at  no  cost,  these  tools  include  Gmail,  Calendar,  Drive,  Sites  and  Classroom.  As  Google continues to  add  new  tools,  LISD  will  evaluate  each  for  its  educational  potential.  LISD may add additional tools within Google Suite for Education throughout the school year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hallways\n\nAll students must have hall passes signed by an administrator or a teacher in order to be in the halls before school, during class,  or  during  lunch.  Passes  to  leave  the  classroom  may  be  secured  from the classroom teacher. While in the halls, students should keep their voices low so as not to disturb others. Students who wish to be in the hallways before school must be given permission from a teacher and have a hall pass.\n\n## Harassment\n\nHarassment will not be tolerated by the District. Students are expected to treat other students and District employees with courtesy  and respect; to avoid any behaviors known to be offensive; and to stop these behaviors when asked or told to stop.\n\nA substantiated complaint against a student will  result  in  appropriate  disciplinary  action, according to the nature of the offense and the Student Code of Conduct.\n\nThe District encourages parental and student support in its efforts to address and prevent harassment in any form in the public schools. Students and/or parents are encouraged to discuss their questions or concerns about the expectations in this area with a teacher, counselor, principal or designee, or the office of Student Support Services, 512-570-0150.\n\n## Harassment on the Basis of Race, Color, Religion, National Origin, Sex, Sexual Orientation, or Disability\n\nStudents must not engage in harassment behaviors motivated by race, color, religion, national origin, or disability directed toward another student.\n\nA student who believes he or she has been harassed by another student or by a District employee is encouraged to report the incident to any campus administrator or staff member. The allegations will be investigated and addressed.\n\nThe student or a parent may appeal the decision of the principal regarding the outcome of the investigation in accordance with policy FNG (LOCAL). Also see policy FNG(EXHIBIT).\n\n## Sexual Harassment/Sexual Abuse\n\nStudents must not engage in unwanted and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature directed toward another student or a District  employee.  This  prohibition  applies  whether  the  conduct  is  by  word,  gesture, or any other sexual  conduct,  including  requests  for  sexual  favors.  All  students  are  expected  to  treat  other  students  and  District employees with courtesy and respect, to avoid any behaviors known to be offensive, and to stop these behaviors when asked or told to stop.\n\nThe District will notify the parents of all students involved in sexual harassment by student(s) when the allegations are not minor and will notify parents of any incident of sexual harassment or sexual abuse by an employee. To the greatest extent possible,  complaints  will  be  treated  as  confidential.  Limited  disclosure  may  be  necessary  to  complete  a  thorough investigation.\n\nA complaint alleging sexual harassment by another student or sexual harassment or sexual abuse by a staff member may be presented by a student and/or parent in a conference with the principal or designee or with the Title IX coordinator, Bryan Miller, bryan.miller@leanderisd.org, 512-570-0150.\n\nThe student or parent may appeal the decision regarding the outcome of the investigation in accordance with policy FFH (LOCAL).\n\n## Late Arrival\n\nIf  a  student  arrives  after  the  start  of  the  school  day,  he/she  must  check  in  with  the attendance office (or a designated place) with a note from a parent, doctor, etc.\n\n## Library Services Student Access\n\nThe  school  library  is  an  important  part  of  each  student's  learning  experience.  LISD  ensures  students  are  given opportunities to use the library and its resources on campus and at home, for pleasure, interest, and research. Libraries  are  open  to  students before and after school each day and individual campuses may offer extended hours for additional  student  access.  Hours  of  operation  vary  among  campuses,  so  schedules  are  posted  at  each library and on campus library websites. Students can also access many electronic library resources, assignment guides, Destiny (the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlibrary online catalog), and Sora (the virtual digital library) from home by going to the campus library web page. Contact the campus librarian for usernames and passwords needed to access subscription resources from home.\n\n## Borrowing Materials\n\nStudents' accounts are safely and efficiently accessed through student ID numbers for library checkouts. While the length of  time  students may keep items can vary, two weeks is common for most books. Generally, students may renew items during  the  initial  loan  period  for  an  additional  two weeks. High-demand items may have shorter circulation periods and renewals on these items may be limited. Students borrow from the library with the understanding that they are responsible for any materials borrowed.\n\n## Fines\n\nIf  applicable,  students,  parents  or  guardians  will  receive  overdue/fine  notices  via  email;  students  may  be  charged  the replacement  cost  for  lost  books  and  assessed  fines  for  damaged  books.  There  is  no  fine  charge  for  overdue  books. Refunds can be made for lost books returned prior to the close of the current fiscal school year; fines for damaged items are not reimbursed.\n\n## Internet\n\nAll  students  are  welcome to use the internet and/or library computers in accordance with the acceptable use guidelines printed in this handbook.\n\n## Interlibrary Loan (ILL)\n\nStudents may request to borrow materials from any library in Leander ISD so long as the library matches the same grade level. (Ex: elementary students borrowing from another elementary library.) Should a student want to borrow from a grade level span higher than the current grade span assigned, parent permission would be required via a signed form posted on the campus library website. All ILL requests are made through the student's home campus librarian, and all items will be checked out and returned through the student's home campus library. ILL items may only be renewed once and lending libraries may deny renewals for high-demand items. Students who fail to return interlibrary loan items on time may have ILL privileges restricted or denied.\n\n## Parental Input\n\nBook purchases are made in accordance with Leander ISD Board Policy EFB; Library collections are developed to meet the diverse needs and interests of our students. While we work to ensure that every reader is able to find the right book, not every book is right for every reader. The librarians in Leander ISD support and encourage parental guidance in book selections parents deem appropriate for their students; LISD Librarians welcome opportunities to meet with parents at any time to discuss the selection process, including access to interlibrary loan materials (please see the Interlibrary Loan (ILL) section above.) To access the Destiny Library catalog, go to the Leander ISD Destiny: click on your campus site, and click on the catalog tab.\n\n## Lockers\n\n## (Secondary Only)\n\nLockers are school property and remain under the jurisdiction of the school even when assigned to an individual student. If  available,  students  may  request  and  will  be  assigned  a  locker  to  facilitate  management  of  books  and  belongings. Because students are responsible for their lockers and their contents, students should use only the locker assigned to them, always keep it locked, and keep the combination confidential. The school reserves the right to inspect all lockers. Searches of lockers may be conducted at any time there is reasonable suspicion to do so, whether a student is present or not.  School  officials  may  randomly  search  lockers  for  articles  or  materials  prohibited  by school district policy. Students shall  be  responsible for any prohibited items found in their lockers. The parent/guardian will be notified if any prohibited items  are  found  in  the  student's  locker.  Therefore,  personal locks will not be allowed. The school is not responsible for misplaced, lost, stolen or damaged personal property, or textbooks. No decals, bumper stickers, nameplates, writing, etc. may be applied to lockers.\n\nStudents  may  not  change  lockers  without  permission  from  their  assistant  principal.  Further  information  regarding responsibility and searches of lockers may be found in Interrogations and Searches.\n\n## Lost and Found\n\nThere is  a  lost  and found area located at each campus. Students are urged to inquire about lost items quickly since all items not claimed at the end of each semester are donated to a charitable organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo reduce the chance of loss, students are cautioned never to leave money or other possessions unprotected. Students advised not to bring valuable items to school to prevent such items from being damaged, lost, or stolen.\n\n## Meals and Cafeteria\n\nThe school kitchen prepares nutritious breakfasts and lunches daily. Students may purchase school meals or bring lunch from home. Students who purchase school meals or bring a lunch from home may also choose to purchase beverages or other extra items that are not included in a school meal.\n\nMenus are posted at each school and on the Nutrislice webpage. If a student needs a special diet, please contact our Registered Dietician at Child Nutrition Services  (512-570-0681) as well as the school nurse.\n\nBreakfast is served on all campuses preceding the beginning of each school day. Lunch is served daily, with start and end times being determined by the campus administration.\n\nThe meal program is maintained in all district schools on a self-supporting, non-profit basis as an optional service to LISD students.  Prices  are  subject  to  change, but typically do not change during the school year. Additional menu information can be found online at the Child Nutrition Services website.\n\nThe district  offers  a  program  of  free  and  reduced  meal  prices  based  on  a student's financial need. Information on this program is available in the school office or on the My School Apps website.\n\nMeals may be purchased on a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis. Prepayments can be accepted at any time with cash, check or online through the link  to Mosiac's website, MySchoolBucks. The money is kept on the student's account and debited with each meal or extra item purchase. Middle schools and high schools also accept payment by credit card.\n\nAny cash received during a transaction will be automatically applied in full to the student's account. No change will be made and returned to the student.\n\nIf students do not have breakfast or lunch money available, they may charge up to $16.00 (approximately the equivalent of  five  lunch  meals).  All meal charges must be repaid the next school day. Should unpaid charges accumulate past the $16.00 limit, students will be provided with a low-cost meal. Students may not charge a la carte items.\n\nParents may provide food for their own child's consumption, but they may not provide food items for other children.\n\nTo keep the school clean and neat, certain rules are established. Food and drink will be allowed only in the cafeteria area, not in any academic area, gym, theater, foyer, band hall, etc. For safety reasons, glass containers are not to be brought onto  the  campus.  Students should dispose of all eating utensils, drink cans, paper, etc. in the appropriate place. Chairs are not to be taken out of the Commons/Cafeteria area.\n\nDuring meals, students are permitted only in designated areas. Students are not allowed to have food delivered to school from commercial establishments.\n\nAll  foods  sold  during  the  school  day  (defined  as  midnight  to  30  minutes  after  the  last  bell)  must  meet  Smart  Snack regulations.  For  more  information on Smart Snacks, visit squaremeals.org. You may also reference our Wellness Policy for district-specific guidance on competitive foods by grade level.\n\nVending machines are available at select campuses where smart snacks, beverages, and reimbursable meals may be purchased using the student's lunch account or credit card.\n\n## Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act\n\nThe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act sets standards for school meals and aims to create healthier meals for kids across the nation.  The  goal  is  to  build  a  healthy  future  for  kids  by  making  school  meals  as  nutritious  as  possible.  Some  of  the guidelines include:\n\n- ● Offering both fruits and vegetables every day\n- ● Serving whole grain foods (breads, rolls, brown rice, tortillas, cereals, breading on nuggets, etc.)\n- ● Offering only fat-free and low-fat milk\n- ● Limiting calories and portion sizes based on the age of the children\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- ● Reducing sodium, saturated fat, and trans fats\n\nThe meal pattern consists of five components - Meat/meat alternate, grain, fruits, vegetables, and milk.\n\nLISD schools follow the 'offer vs. serve' program to help decrease food waste and give students a choice at mealtimes. Students may select a minimum of three of the above components and a maximum of five components, but one must be a fruit or vegetable. The only item that is required of all five components is a fruit or a vegetable.\n\n## Notice of Non-Discrimination\n\n## (All levels)\n\nLeander Independent School District does not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex, or disability in providing education services, activities and programs, including vocational programs in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights  Act  of  1964,  as  amended;  Title  IX  of  the  Education  Amendments  of  1972;  and  Section  504  of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Contact:\n\n- ● Bryan Miller,  bryan.miller@leanderisd.org,  Title  IX  Coordinator,  for  concerns, regarding discrimination based on sex.\n- ● Angela Patrick, Section 504 Coordinator, for concerns regarding discrimination based on a disability.\n\nLeander Independent School District does not discriminate based on disability by denying access to the benefits of District services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.\n\n## Notice of Parent and Student Rights\n\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. Sec.1232g\n\nBoth  federal  and  state  laws  safeguard  student  records  from  unauthorized  inspection  or  use  and  provide  parents  and eligible students certain rights. For purposes of student records, an 'eligible' student is one who is 18 or older OR who is attending an institution of postsecondary education.\n\nCertain information about District students is considered directory information and will be released to anyone who follows the procedures for requesting the information unless the parent or guardian objects to the release of the  directory  information  about  the  student.  If  you  do  not  want  Leander  ISD  to  disclose  directory  information from your child's education records without your prior written consent, you must notify the District in writing. Leander  ISD  has  designated  the  following  information  as  directory  information:  student's  name,  address, telephone listing, photograph, honors and awards, received dates of attendance, grade level, most recent school attended/attending,  participation  in  officially  recognized  activities  and  sports,  and  the  weight  and  height  of members of athletic teams.\n\nVirtually  all  information  pertaining  to  student  performance,  including  grades,  test  results,  and  disciplinary  records,  is considered confidential educational records. Release is restricted to:\n\n- ● The parents - whether married, separated, or divorced - unless the school is given a copy of a court order terminating parental rights or the right to access a student's educational records. Federal law requires that, as soon as a student becomes 18 years old or is emancipated by a court, control of the records goes to the student. The parents may continue to have access to the records, however, if the student is a dependent for tax purposes.\n- ● District staff members who have what federal law refers to as a 'legitimate educational interest' in a student's records. 'Legitimate educational interest' in a student's records includes working with the student; considering disciplinary or academic actions, the student's case, or an individualized education program for a student with disabilities; compiling statistical data; or investigating or evaluating programs. Such persons would include school officials (such as Board members, the superintendent, administrators, and principals); school staff members (such as teachers, counselors, diagnosticians, and support staff); a person or company with whom the District has contracted to provide a particular service (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); a parent or student serving on a school committee; a parent or student assisting a school official or staff in the performance of his or her duties or various governmental agencies.\n- ● Individuals granted access in response to a subpoena or court order.\n- ● A school or institution of postsecondary education to which a student seeks or intends to enroll or in which he or she subsequently enrolls.\n\nReleases to any other person or agency - such as a prospective employer or for a scholarship application - will occur only with parental or student permission as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe principal is custodian of all records for currently enrolled students at the assigned school, and for students who have withdrawn or graduated.\n\nRequest to view records can be made at: student.records@leanderisd.org. A parent or (or eligible student) may inspect the student's records during regular school hours. If circumstances effectively prevent a parent (or eligible student) from inspecting  the  records,  the  District  will  make  alternate  arrangements  to  review  the  requested  records.  The  records custodian or designee will respond to a reasonable request for explanation and interpretation of the records.\n\nCopies of student records  are available for a fee. Request  for  copies  of student records  can  be  made  at student.records@leanderisd.org.\n\nThe addresses of the principals' offices are found at the back of this handbook.\n\nA parent (or  eligible  student)  may  inspect  the  student's  records  and  request  a correction if the records are considered inaccurate  or  otherwise  in  violation  of  the  student's  privacy  rights.  A  request  to  correct  a  student's  record  should  be submitted  to  the  principal  or  superintendent.  The  request  must  clearly  identify  the  part  of  the  record  that  should  be corrected and include an explanation of how the information in the record is inaccurate. If the District denies the request to amend the records, the parent or eligible student has the right to request a hearing. If the records are not amended as a result  of  the  hearing,  the  parent  or  eligible  student  has  30  school  days  to  exercise  the  right  to  place  a  statement commenting  on  the  information  in  the  student's  record.  Although  improperly  recorded  grades  may  be  challenged, contesting a student's grade in a course is handled through the general complaint process found in policy FNG (LOCAL).\n\nThe  District's policy regarding  student records  found  at FL  (LOCAL)  is  available  on  the District's website  at www.leanderisd.org.\n\nParents or eligible  students  have the right to file a complaint with the U. S. Department of Education if they believe the district is not in compliance with the law regarding student records.\n\n## Notification of Rights under FERPA\n\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents and students who are 18 years of age or older (\"eligible students\") certain rights with respect to the student's education records. These rights are:\n\n- 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the school receives a request for access.\n- 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA.\n- 3. The right to provide written consent before the school discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.\n\nOne  exception,  which  permits  disclosure  without  consent,  is  disclosure  to  school  officials  with  legitimate educational  interests.  A  school  official  is  a  person  employed  by  the  school  as  an  administrator,  supervisor, instructor,  or  support  staff  member  (including  health  or  medical  staff  and  law  enforcement unit personnel) or a person serving on the school board. A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the school  who  performs  an  institutional  service  of  function  for  which  the  school  would  otherwise  use  its  own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist; a parent or student volunteering to  serve  on  an  official  committee,  such  as  a  disciplinary  or grievance committee; or a parent, student, or other volunteer  assisting  another  school  official  in  performing  his  or  her  tasks.  A  school  official  has  a  legitimate educational  interest  if  the  official  needs  to  review  an  education  record  in  order  to  fulfill  his  or her professional responsibility.\n\n- 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the [School] to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA are:\n\nFamily Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education\n\n400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202\n\n- 5. For additional information, please refer to Leander ISD Board Policies FL (Legal) and FL (Local).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Open House\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  school  year,  all  Leander  ISD  campuses  host  an  Open  House.  Parents  are invited to visit their student's  school  where  they will have an opportunity to meet their student's teachers and be given an orientation to the contents and requirements of each course.\n\n## Opting Out of Surveys and Activities\n\nParents have the right to receive notice and opt their child out of:\n\n- ● Participation in any survey concerning the information listed above,\n- ● School activities involving the collection, disclosure, or use of personal information collected from their child for the purpose of marketing or selling that information,\n- ● Any non-emergency, invasive physical examination or screening as a condition of attendance, administered and scheduled by the school in advance and not necessary to protect the immediate health and safety of the student. Exceptions are hearing, vision, or scoliosis screenings, or any physical exam or screening permitted or required under state law.\n\n## Options and Requirements for Providing Assistance to Students Who Have Learning Difficulties or Who Need or May Need Special Education\n\nFor  those  students  who  are  having  difficulty  in  the  regular  classroom,  all  school  districts  and  open-enrollment  charter schools must consider tutorial,  compensatory,  and other academic or behavior support services that are available to all students,  including  a  process  based  on  Response  to  Intervention  (RtI).  The  implementation  of  RtI  has the potential to have a positive impact on the ability of districts and charter schools to meet the needs of all struggling students.\n\n- If a  student  is  experiencing  learning  difficulties,  his  or  her  parent  may  contact  their  campus  administrator  or  the individual(s)  listed  below  to  learn  about  the  school's  overall  general  education  referral or screening system for support services.  This  system  links  students  to  a  variety  of  support  options, including making a referral for a special education evaluation or for a Section 504 evaluation to determine if the student needs specific aids, accommodations, or services. A parent may request an evaluation for special education or Section 504 services at any time by submitting the request in writing to their child's teacher or campus administrator.\n\n## Special Education Referrals:\n\nIf  a  parent  makes  a  written  request  for  an  initial  evaluation  for  special  education  services  to  the  director  of  special education services or an administrative employee of the school district or open enrollment charter school, the district or charter school must respond no later than 15 school days after receiving the request. At that time, the district or charter school must give the parent a prior written notice of whether it agrees to or refuses to evaluate the student, along with a copy of the Notice of Procedural Safeguards. If the school district or charter school agrees to evaluate the student, it must also give the parent the opportunity to give written consent for the evaluation.\n\nPlease note that a request for a special education evaluation may be made verbally and does not need to be in writing. Districts and charter schools must still comply with all federal prior written notice and procedural safeguard requirements and the requirements for identifying, locating, and evaluating children who are suspected of being a child with a disability and in  need  of  special  education.  However,  a  verbal  request  does  not  require  the district or charter school to respond within the 15-school-day timeline.\n\nIf  the  district  or  charter  school  decides  to  evaluate  the  student,  it  must  complete  the  student's  initial  evaluation  and evaluation report no later than 45 school days from the day it receives a parent's written consent to evaluate the student. However, if the student is absent from school during the evaluation period for three or more school days, the evaluation period will be extended by the number of school days equal to the number of school days that the student is absent.\n\nThere is an exception to the 45-school-day timeline. If a district or charter school receives a parent's consent for the initial evaluation at least 35 but less than 45 school days before the last instructional day of the school year, it must complete the written report and provide a copy of the report to the parent by June 30 of that year. However, if the student is absent from school for three or more days during the evaluation period, the June 30th due date no longer applies. Instead, the general timeline of 45 school days plus extensions for absences of three or more days will apply.\n\nUpon completing the evaluation, the district or charter school must give the parent a copy of the evaluation report at no cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditional information regarding special education is available from the district or charter school in a companion document titled Parent's Guide to the Admission, Review, and Dismissal Process.\n\n## Special Education Referrals:\n\nFor a student experiencing learning difficulties or regarding a referral for evaluation for special education services  please contact Paige Collier at 512-570-0300.\n\n## Section 504 Referrals:\n\nEach school district or charter school must have standards and procedures in place for the evaluation and placement of students  in  the  district's  or  charter  school's  Section  504  program.  Districts  and  charter  schools must also implement a system of procedural safeguards that includes notice, an opportunity for a parent or guardian to examine relevant records, an impartial hearing with an opportunity for participation by the parent or guardian and representation by counsel, and a review  procedure. For  student  experiencing  learning  difficulties  or  regarding  a  referral  for  evaluation  for  Section  504 services please  contact Angela Patrick at 512-570-0311.\n\n## Additional Information:\n\nThe following websites provide information and resources for students with disabilities and their families.\n\n- ● Legal Framework for the Child-Centered Special Education Process\n- ● Partners Resource Network\n- ● Special Education Information Center\n- ● Texas Project First\n\n## Parent/Teacher Conferences\n\nThe school encourages communication through parent/teacher conferences. A parent who wants information or wants to raise  a  question  or  concern  should  confer  with the appropriate teacher, counselor, or principal. A parent who wishes to conference with a teacher may call the teacher for an appointment during the teacher's conference period or request that the teacher call the parent during a conference period or at another mutually convenient time. Teachers are not permitted to  leave  their  classrooms  during  instructional  time  for parent conferences unless there is an emergency. Teachers may schedule one or more conferences during each school year with the parents as needed to support student success.\n\n## Parental Rights\n\n- ● To inspect all instructional materials, textbooks, and other teaching aids used in the classroom of the parent's child, and to review each test after it has been administered to their child.\n- ● To access of all written records of a school district concerning the parent's child.\n- ● To request information regarding the professional qualifications of their child's teachers.\n- ● To inspect a survey created by a third party before the survey is administered or distributed to their child.\n- ● To grant or deny any written request from the district to make a videotape or voice recording of the child. State law, however, permits the school to make a videotape or voice recording without parental permission when it is used for school safety, relates to classroom instruction or a co-curricular or extracurricular activity, or when it relates to media coverage.\n- ● To request that your child be excused from participation in the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag and the Pledge of Allegiance to the state flag. The request must be in writing. State law does not allow your child to be excused from participation in the required moment of silence or silent activity that follows.\n- ● To request that your child be excused from reciting a portion of the text of the Declaration of Independence during Celebrate Freedom Week. The request must be in writing. State law requires the recitation as part of social studies classes in grades 3-12 unless (1) you provide a written statement requesting that your child be excused,\n- ● (2) the District determines that your child has a conscientious objection to the recitation, or (3) you are a representative of a foreign government to whom the United States government extends diplomatic immunity.\n\n## Parties\n\n## (Elementary Only)\n\nThere will be two (2) official school parties per year for each class to be determined by the individual campus. A student's classmates will  recognize  him/her  on  his/her  birthday  and  make  the student feel special. Because learning is our most important  job,  we  will  not  take  time  out from our class time to share balloons or other party favors on birthdays. Out of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrespect  and  concern  for  others,  invitations  to  private  parties  may  not  be  distributed  at  school  unless distributed to the entire class.\n\n## Permission to Leave Campus\n\n## (Elementary &amp; Middle School Only)\n\nLeander ISD Schools are closed campuses. Once students arrive, they are not permitted to leave the school campus during the day. This means that no student will be allowed to leave campus to go to lunch, a convenience store, a place of business, or into the surrounding neighborhood. This rule is established for students' safety.\n\nIf  a student must leave campus before the end of the day, arrangements may be made through a visit, a call, or written note  from  the  parent.  The  note  should  contain  the  following  information:  name  of  student,  reason  for  leaving  school campus, time the student is to leave school, person to whom the student is to be released, and parent's signature.\n\n## (High School Only)\n\nLeander ISD High Schools are closed campuses. Once students arrive, they are not permitted to leave the school campus during the day. This rule is established for the students' safety. Parents are asked not to call the school to have permits delivered  to  students.  Should  an  emergency  arise,  an administrator should be notified. If a student must leave campus before the end of the day, arrangements must be made through a written note from the parent. The note should contain the following information: name of student, grade and ID number, reason for leaving school campus, time the student is to leave  school,  person  to  whom  the  student  is  to  be  released,  and  parent's  signature.  All school time used for personal business will be unexcused unless a pre-arranged absence form has been approved by an administrator.\n\n## Persistently Dangerous Schools\n\nAny student who attends a school that has been designated as persistently dangerous as determined by the Texas Education Agency, or any student who becomes a victim of a violent criminal offense while in or on the grounds of the public school that the student attends, will be allowed to transfer to another school within the District upon request. See Board Policies FDE (Legal), FDE (Local).\n\n## Pledges of Allegiance and A Minute of Silence\n\nTexas law requires students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the United States flag and the Pledge of Allegiance to the Texas flag  each  day.  Upon  written request from a student's parent, the campus may excuse the student from reciting a pledge of allegiance.\n\nA minute of silence will follow the recitation of the pledges. The student may choose to reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity so long as the silent activity does not interfere with or distract others.\n\n## Prior Parental Consent Needed\n\nStudents shall not be required to participate in a survey, analysis, or evaluation as part of any program that reveals information concerning the following topics without prior written consent of parents. Parents will be able to inspect such material.\n\n- 1. Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student's parents.\n- 2. Mental and psychological problems of the student or the student's family.\n- 3. Sex behavior and attitudes.\n- 4. Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, and demeaning behavior.\n- 5. Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have a close family relationship.\n- 6. Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers, physicians and ministers.\n- 7. Religious practices, affiliation, or beliefs of the student and the student's parent.\n- 8. Income (other than that required to determine a child's eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance under such a program).\n\n## Questions, Concerns, Complaints\n\nAll  questions,  concerns,  or  complaints  should  be  addressed  to  the  staff  member  involved  in  the  issue.  i.e.  teacher, counselor,  coach,  etc.  If  the  issue  is  not  resolved  at  this  level,  then  the  student/parent  should  contact  the  assistant principal who works with the student. If the assistant principal cannot resolve the issue, the student/parent should contact the campus principal. If the issue involves the assistant principal, then the campus principal should be contacted. Student Support  Services  may  be  contacted  if  the  student/parent  does  not  get  resolution  of  the  issue  after  meeting  with  the campus principal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf the informal meetings fail to reach the outcome requested by the student or parent, the student or parent may initiate the formal process by timely filing a written complaint (board policy FNG). Formal Level I parent/student grievances should be directed  to  the  campus  Principal  and  Student  Support  Services.  During  this  process  the  complaint  will  be  thoroughly reviewed and researched.\n\nIf the parent/student needs are not met following a level I grievance, a level II grievance can be filed. Should the results at level II not satisfy the parent/student, a level III grievance may be filed and referred to the Superintendent and Board and Trustees.\n\nBelow you will find additional information regarding the grievance process.\n\n- 1. Parent/student complaints and concerns should be addressed in accordance with Policy FNG (LOCAL). A copy of the policy may be obtained from an administrator's office or found on the Leander ISD website at www.leanderisd.org.\n- 2. A student and/or parent with a complaint regarding possible discrimination based on sex, in any school program, should contact Bryan Miller, Title IX coordinator.\n- 3. A complaint or concern a student with disabilities, or about the District's programs and services available to the student, should contact Shannon White.\n\n## Restrooms\n\nStudents should assume responsibility for proper care and use of the restrooms. These facilities are not for loitering or congregating.\n\n## Services for the Homeless\n\nFor information regarding Homeless services under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Act, please reference the district website. Kristen Sterling, the District Homeless Liaison for Children and Youths, can be reached at 512-570-5931.\n\n## Services for Students in Foster Care\n\nFor Information regarding Every Student Succeeds Act and the Education of Students in Foster care, please contact Kristen Sterling at 512-570-5931.\n\n## Special Education Records\n\nPersonally  identifiable  information  that  is  maintained  to  provide  educational services to students with disabilities will be destroyed  seven  years  after  the  student  has  been  dismissed  or  graduated,  unless  the  parent  notifies  the  District otherwise.  Two  public  notices  are  made  one  week  apart  and  at  least  30  calendar  days  prior  to  the destruction of any records,  during  which  time  parents  of  students  with  disabilities  or  adult  persons  with  disabilities  may notify the District should they want records to be maintained.\n\n## Student Email Addresses\n\nStudents in 6th -12th grade will be assigned a LISD student email account. This account will be considered the student's official  email  address  until  such  time  as  the  student  is  no  longer  enrolled  in  LISD.  The  naming  convention  will  be firstname.lastname followed by the last two digits of their student ID, ending with @k12.leanderisd.org. Upon graduation from high school, the students' email will migrate to @alum.leandersid.org for a period of five years.\n\n## Student Identification Cards\n\n## (High School Only)\n\nAll students will be issued a high school identification (I.D.) Card that they must carry with them during school and to all school functions. The first I.D. card is free and comes as part of the student's pictures. Students choosing not to purchase pictures should have their pictures taken just for the I.D. card. Those students choosing not to have pictures made at all must pay a $5.00 fee for their cards. Replacement cards cost $5.00. New students enrolling after student picture day will receive their first card free. Students are subject to disciplinary actions for failure to carry their school identification cards.\n\n## Student Parking Regulations\n\n(High School Only)\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDriving  a  vehicle  on  campus  is  a  privilege  afforded to students. With this privilege comes the responsibility to abide by certain  rules  and  regulations.  Students  may  lose  the  privilege  to  drive  and  park  on  all  school property if the rules and regulations are not observed.\n\nAll  cars  and  motorcycles  driven to school by students must be registered and parked in the designated student parking areas.

Repeat  offenders  may  have  their permit revoked or their vehicle towed at the owner's expense.\n\nThe speed limit on school property is 15 m.p.h. This speed is established for the safety of everyone. Once the student drives on campus, the student should park and lock the vehicle. Use of vehicles is prohibited until the end of the school day unless permission is received from the assistant principal.

Vehicles parked on school property may be searched by school officials if there is reasonable suspicion to believe the vehicle contains articles  or materials prohibited by district policy. Students shall be responsible for any prohibited items found in vehicles parked  on  school  property.  (See  \"Interrogations  and  Searches.\")  Driving/parking  violations  will  result  in  loss  of  driving privileges,  fines,  and/or  other  disciplinary  consequences. Students must have a pass from an administrator to be in the parking lot during school hours.\n\n## Student Pick-Up Procedures\n\n## (All Levels)\n\nIf parents wish to pick up a student prior to the end of school, parents must come to the attendance office, show their ID, and request their student. They must also sign their student out. Ordinarily, students will be released only to their parents. If the student is to be released to someone else, the student must have a note from the parent stating so. If there are any restrictions  prohibiting  any  individuals  from  contacting  a  student,  the proper legal documents must be on file at school. Parents are reminded that the curbing in front of the building is restricted from all parking.\n\n## Student Religious Expression in Classroom Assignments\n\nStudents  may  express  their  beliefs  about  religion  in  their  school  assignments  to  the  same  extent  that  non-religious expression is allowed. Assignments should be judged by ordinary academic standards of substance and relevance, and against other legitimate pedagogical criteria identified by the school.\n\n## Student Right to Pray\n\nThe school recognizes a student's right to voluntarily pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school. The school will not require, encourage, or coerce a student to engage in or to refrain from such prayer or meditation during any school activity.\n\n## Student Rights, Safety and Discipline\n\nProtection of Student Rights under 20 U.S.C.

A complete copy of the Acceptable Use Guidelines is found in the Appendix. All students are responsible for abiding by these guidelines. Special attention must be paid to the issues of:\n\n- ● Consent Requirements\n- ● Account and Password Requirements\n- ● Prohibition on Vandalism\n- ● Web Publishing Standards\n- ● Availability of Access\n- ● Acceptable Use\n- ● Internet Safety/ Digital Citizenship\n- ● Prohibited Activities\n- ● Intellectual Property Rights and Privacy\n- ● Google Workspace for Education\n- ● Use of Personally Owned Technology Devices (BYOT)\n\n## Telephones/Cell Phones\n\n## (All levels)\n\nThere is  a  phone  available  for  student  use  on  each  campus.  These  phones  are for limited use only and may be used before  or  after  school.  Use  of  cell  phones  is  regulated  by  the  individual  campus.  Students  may  receive  telephone messages  only  in  emergency  situations.  Telephones  in  classrooms  are  for  official  use  only  and  are  not  intended  for student use.\n\n## Textbooks\n\nAll textbooks are the property of Leander ISD. The use of these textbooks is the right of every student. This right carries with it the basic responsibility of proper use and good care. A student who is issued a damaged book should report that fact  to  the  teacher.  In  the  event  books are lost, new ones cannot be issued until payment has been made. However, a student will be provided textbooks for use at school during the school day.\n\nPayments for lost textbooks are due within three (3) days. Refunds will be given through the close of the last school day of the current school year. After this date the books will become the property of the student.\n\n## Toys\n\nOnly with prior approval from school personnel may students bring toys to school. Toys can be confiscated if rules are not followed. Schools are not responsible for the loss or damage to these items.\n\n## Visitors\n\nParents and others are welcome to visit district schools. For the safety of those within the school and to avoid disruption of instructional  time,  all  visitors  must  first  report  to  the  main  office  and  comply  with  all  applicable  district  policies  and procedures. All visitors should be prepared to show identification.\n\nIndividuals may schedule to visit classrooms or observe virtual instruction during instructional time only with the approval of  the  principal  and  teacher.  Individuals  will  be  escorted  during  the  visit.  Visitors  may  not  interfere  with  instruction  or disrupt the normal school environment.\n\nAll visitors are expected to demonstrate the highest standards of courtesy and conduct. Disruptive behavior or violations of student privacy will not be permitted. Please note that parents and visitors to a classroom, both virtual and in person, may not record video or audio or take photographs or other still images without permission from the teacher or other school official.\n\n## Withdrawal of Students\n\nStudents  withdrawing  from  school  prior  to  the  end  of  the  official  school  year  are  given  a  withdrawal  report  indicating grades up to the time of withdrawal. Students withdrawing from school before the end of a semester will not have their grades finalized  by  LISD.  It will be the responsibility of the receiving school to finalize grades. Promotion or retention is\n\nRevised: November 20, 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nalso  at  the  discretion  of  the  receiving  school.  A  copy  of  this  procedure  will  be  included  in  the  records  of  students withdrawing prior to the end of the official school year.\n\nTo  facilitate  withdrawal  of  students  from  school,  parents  are  requested  to  advise  the  campus  registrar  of  an  intended withdrawal three  days  prior  to  leaving.  A  parent  is  required to meet with the registrar to sign the withdrawal paperwork prior to the student's departure. This will provide adequate time for contacting teachers, closing the student's records and preparing  transfer  documents.  All  lunch  charges,  library  fines,  parking  fines/fees,  lost  textbook  fees,  and  fees  for  lost school equipment must be paid prior to withdrawal."
