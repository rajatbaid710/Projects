## PURPOSE OF INSPECTION

A real estate inspection is a visual survey of a structure and a basic performance evaluation of the systems and components of a building. It provides information regarding the general condition of a residence at the time the inspection was conducted. It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information. Ask the inspector to clarify any items or comments that are unclear.

## RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INSPECTOR

This  inspection  is  governed  by  the  Texas  Real  Estate  Commission  (TREC)  Standards  of  Practice  (SOPs),  which  dictates  the minimum requirements for a real estate inspection.

The inspector IS required to:

- use this Property Inspection Report form for the inspection;
- inspect only those components and conditions that are present, visible, and accessible at the time of the inspection;
- indicate whether each item was inspected, not inspected, or not present;
- indicate an item as Deficient (D) if a condition exists that adversely and materially affects the performance of a system or component OR constitutes a hazard to life, limb or property as specified by the SOPs; and
- explain the inspector's findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.

The inspector IS NOT required to:

- identify all potential hazards;
- turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utilities, or apply an open flame or light a pilot to operate any appliance;
- climb over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items;
- prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another;
- provide follow-up services to verify that proper repairs have been made; or
- inspect system or component listed under the optional section of the SOPs (22 TAC 535.233).

## RESPONSIBILTY OF THE CLIENT

While items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions, in the  event  that  any  further  evaluations  are  needed,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  the  client  to  obtain  further  evaluations  and/or  cost estimates from qualified service professionals regarding any items reported as Deficient (D). It is recommended that any further evaluations and/or cost estimates take place prior to the expiration of any contractual time limitations, such as option periods.

Please Note: Evaluations performed by service professionals in response to items reported as Deficient (D) on the report may lead to  the  discovery of additional deficiencies that were not present, visible, or accessible at the time of the inspection. Any repairs made after the date of the inspection may render information contained in this report obsolete or invalid.

## REPORT LIMITATIONS

This report is provided for the benefit of the named client and is based on observations made by the named inspector on the date the inspection was performed (indicated above).

ONLY those items specifically noted as being inspected on the report were inspected.

This inspection IS NOT:

- a technically exhaustive inspection of the structure, its systems, or its components and may not reveal all deficiencies;
- an inspection to verify compliance with any building codes;
- an inspection to verify compliance with manufacturer's installation instructions for any system or component and DOES NOT imply insurability or warrantability of the structure or its components.

## NOTICE CONCERNING HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS, DEFICIENCIES, AND CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS

Conditions may be present in your home that did not violate building codes or common practices in effect when the home was constructed but are considered hazardous by today's standards. Such conditions that were part of the home prior to the adoption  of  any  current  codes  prohibiting  them  may  not  be  required  to  be  updated  to  meet  current  code  requirements. However, if it can be reasonably determined that they are present at the time of the inspection, the potential for injury or property loss from these conditions is significant enough to require inspectors to report them as Deficient (D). Examples of such hazardous conditions include:

- malfunctioning, improperly installed, or missing ground fault circuit protection (GFCI) devices and arc-fault (AFCI) devices;
- ordinary glass in locations where modern construction techniques call for safety glass;
- malfunctioning  or  lack  of  fire  safety  features  such  as  smoke  alarms,  fire-rated  doors  in  certain  locations,  and  functional emergency escape and rescue openings in bedrooms;
- malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarms;
- excessive spacing between balusters on stairways and porches;
- improperly installed appliances;
- improperly installed or defective safety devices;
- lack of electrical bonding and grounding; and
- lack of bonding on gas piping, including corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST).

Please Note: items identified as Deficient (D) in an inspection report DO NOT obligate any party to make repairs or take other actions. The decision to correct a hazard or any deficiency identified in an inspection report is left up to the parties to the contract for the sale or purchase of the home.

This property inspection report may include an inspection agreement (contract), addenda, and other information related to property conditions.

INFORMATION INCLUDED UNDER 'ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INSPECTOR', OR PROVIDED AS AN ATTACHMENT WITH THE STANDARD FORM, IS NOT REQUIRED BY THE COMMISSION AND MAY CONTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS BETWEEN THE INSPECTOR AND YOU, AS THE CLIENT. THE COMMISSION DOES NOT REGULATE  CONTRACTUAL  TERMS  BETWEEN  PARTIES.  IF  YOU  DO  NOT  UNDERSTAND  THE  EFFECT  OF  ANY CONTRACTUAL TERM CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION OR ANY ATTACHMENTS, CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.

## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INSPECTOR

## PURPOSE, LIMITATIONS AND INSPECTOR / CLIENT RESPONSIBILITIES

This  property  inspection  report  may  include  an  inspection  agreement  (contract),  addenda,  and  other information  related  to  property  conditions.  If  any  item  or  comment  is  unclear,  you  should  ask  the inspector to clarify the findings. It is important that you carefully read ALL of this information.

This inspection is subject to the rules ('Rules') of the Texas Real Estate Commission ('TREC'), which can be found at www.trec.texas.gov.

The TREC Standards of Practice (Sections 535.227-535.233 of the Rules) are the minimum standards for inspections by TREC-licensed inspectors. An inspection addresses only those components and conditions that  are  present,  visible,  and  accessible  at  the  time  of  the  inspection.  While  there  may  be  other  parts, components or systems present, only those items specifically noted as being inspected were inspected. The inspector is NOT required to turn on decommissioned equipment, systems, utility services or apply an  open  flame  or  light  a  pilot  to  operate  any  appliance.  The  inspector  is  NOT  required  to  climb  over obstacles, move furnishings or stored items. The inspection report may address issues that are code-based or  may  refer  to  a  particular  code;  however,  this  is  NOT  a  code  compliance  inspection  and  does  NOT verify compliance  with  manufacturer's  installation  instructions. The  inspection  does  NOT  imply insurability  or  warrantability  of  the  structure  or  its  components.  Although  some  safety  issues  may  be addressed  in  this  report,  this  inspection  is  NOT  a  safety/code  inspection,  and  the  inspector  is  NOT required to identify all potential hazards.

.

In this report, the inspector shall indicate, by checking the appropriate boxes on the form, whether each item was inspected, not inspected, not present or deficient and explain the findings in the corresponding section in the body of the report form.  The inspector must check the Deficient (D) box if a condition exists  that  adversely  and  materially  affects  the  performance  of  a  system  or  component  or  constitutes  a hazard  to  life,  limb  or  property  as  specified  by  the  TREC  Standards  of  Practice.  General  deficiencies include inoperability, material distress, water penetration, damage, deterioration, missing components, and unsuitable installation. Comments may be provided by the inspector whether or not an item is deemed deficient. The inspector is not required to prioritize or emphasize the importance of one deficiency over another.

Some items reported may be considered life-safety upgrades to the property. For more information, refer to Texas Real Estate Consumer Notice Concerning Recognized Hazards or Deficiencies below.

THIS PROPERTY INSPECTION IS NOT A TECHNICALLY EXHAUSTIVE INSPECTION OF THE STRUCTURE, SYSTEMS OR COMPONENTS. The inspection may not reveal all deficiencies. A real estate inspection helps to reduce some of the risk involved in purchasing a home, but it cannot eliminate these risks, nor can the inspection anticipate future events or changes in performance due to changes in use  or  occupancy.  It  is  recommended  that  you  obtain  as  much  information  as  is  available  about  this property, including any seller's disclosures, previous inspection reports, engineering reports, building/remodeling permits, and reports performed for or by relocation companies, municipal inspection departments,  lenders,  insurers,  and  appraisers.  You  should  also  attempt  to  determine  whether  repairs, renovation, remodeling, additions, or other such activities have taken place at this property. It is not the inspector's responsibility to confirm that information obtained from these sources is complete or accurate or that this inspection is consistent with the opinions expressed in previous or future reports.

ITEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT DO NOT OBLIGATE ANY PARTY TO MAKE REPAIRS OR TAKE  OTHER  ACTIONS,  NOR  IS  THE  PURCHASER  REQUIRED  TO  REQUEST  THAT  THE SELLER TAKE ANY ACTION.  When a deficiency is reported, it is the client's responsibility to obtain further evaluations and/or cost estimates from qualified service professionals. Any such follow-up should take place prior to the expiration of any time limitations such as option periods. Evaluations by qualified tradesmen may lead to the discovery of additional deficiencies which may involve additional repair costs. Failure  to  address  deficiencies  or  comments  noted  in  this  report  may  lead  to  further  damage  of  the structure or systems and add to the original repair costs.  The inspector is not required to provide followup services to verify that proper repairs have been made.

When a deficiency is  reported,  it  is  the  client's  responsibility  to  obtain  further  evaluations  and/or  cost estimates from qualified and licensed (if applicable) service professionals.   Property conditions change with time and use. For example, mechanical devices can fail at any time, plumbing gaskets and seals may crack if the appliance or plumbing fixture is not used often, roof leaks can occur at any time regardless of the apparent condition of the roof, and the performance of the structure and the systems may change due to changes in use or occupancy, effects of weather, etc. These changes or repairs made to the structure after the inspection may render information contained herein obsolete or invalid. This report is provided for  the  specific  benefit  of  the  client  named  above  and  is  based  on  observations  at  the  time  of  the inspection. If you did not hire the inspector yourself, reliance on this report may provide incomplete or outdated  information.  Repairs,  professional  opinions  or  additional  inspection  reports  may  affect  the meaning of the information in this report. It is recommended that you hire a licensed inspector to perform an inspection to meet your specific needs and to provide you with current information concerning this property.

## TEXAS REAL ESTATE CONSUMER NOTICE CONCERNING HAZARDS OR DEFICIENCIES

Each  year,  Texans  sustain  property  damage  and  are  injured  by  accidents  in  the  home.  While  some accidents may not be avoidable, many other accidents, injuries, and deaths may be avoided through the identification and repair of certain hazardous conditions. Examples of such hazards include: malfunctioning,  improperly  installed  or  missing  ground  fault  circuit  protection  (GFCI)  devices  for electrical receptacles in garages, bathroom, kitchens, and exterior areas; malfunctioning arc fault protection (AFCI) devices; ordinary glass in locations where modern construction techniques call for safety glass; malfunctioning or lack of fire safety features such as, smoke alarms, fire-rated doors in certain locations,

and functional emergency escape and rescue openings in bedrooms; malfunctioning carbon monoxide alarms; airways and porches; excessive spacing between balusters on st improperly installed appliances; safety devices; improperly installed or defective lack of electrical bonding and grounding; and gated stainless steel tubing (CSST). lack of bonding on gas piping, including corru

To  ensure  that  consumers  are  informed  of  hazards  such  as  these,  the  Texas  Real  Estate  Commission (TREC)  has  adopted  Standards  of  Practice  requiring  licensed  inspectors  to  report  these  conditions  as 'Deficient' when performing an inspection for a buyer or seller, if they can be reasonably determined.

These  conditions  may  not  have  violated  building  codes  or  common  practices  at  the  time  of  the construction of the home, or they may have been 'grandfathered' because they were present prior to the adoption  of  codes  prohibiting  such  conditions.  While  the  TREC  Standards  of  Practice  do  not  require inspectors to perform a code compliance inspection, TREC considers the potential for injury or property loss  from  the  hazards  addressed  in  the  Standards  of  Practice  to  be  significant  enough  to  warrant  this notice.

Contract forms developed by TREC for use by its real estate licensees also inform the buyer of the right to have the home inspected and can provide an option clause permitting the buyer to terminate the contract within a specified time. Neither the Standards of Practice nor the TREC contract forms requires a seller to remedy conditions revealed by an inspection. The decision to correct a hazard or any deficiency identified in an inspection report is left to the parties to the contract for the sale or purchase of the home.

Foundation Performance Opinion:

Performing - At this time, the foundation appears to be supporting the structure and immediate significant repair needs are not evident.  Seasonal expansion and contraction observed which is considered normal for age, location and soil conditions.  No major movement noted at the time of inspection.

## Elevation Map:

Disclaimer:  The attached elevations are used for information purposes only and should not be used for serious negotiations.  GreenWorks inspectors are not qualified professional engineers and are not attempting to imitate one.  If you have any concerns about the foundation life expectancy, insurability, or the potential for future problems, a professional engineer should be consulted.

## Additional Comments:

Some trees may remove a few hundred gallons of water in a single day through transpiration and if they are allowed to grow too close to the structure could cause foundation problems.

tion.  It is not unusual to see a Soil movement, settlement, or upheaval is directly transmitted to the founda foundation in this region move in response to moisture various that normally attend seasonal changes. Settlement of a foundation that is seasonal related usually occurs during the hot and dry summer months when the soil can sometimes dry out to a depth of more than ten feet.  This drying or desiccation occurs from soil surface evaporation and transpiration of water from vegetation.  Large bushes such as Red Tip Photinias and River-bottom trees consume a lot of water and should not be planted near a foundation.  Heaving of a foundation that is seasonally related usually occurs during the colder and wetter months.  Usually the winter months are wetter, so soils in our area tend to swell and raise the foundation. Differential foundation movement is normally the result of variations in the moisture content of the soil such as: non-uniform watering of vegetation, poor drainage way from the foundation, or leaking plumbing lines.  It is possible that portions of a foundation that have previously not moved can move sometime in the future.  It should be noted that clay type soils have higher bearing capacity but are subject to more movement, while sandy type soils have lower bearing capacity but are subject to less movement.

The inspector is not a professional engineer and is giving an opinion as mandatory.  If you have any concerns about the foundation life expectancy, insurability, or the potential for future problems, a professional engineer should be consulted.

- icators of possible adverse performance; or (B) provide an exhaustive list of ind
- (C) inspect retaining walls not related to foundation performance.

The foundation performance opinion stated below neither in any way addresses future foundation movement or settlement, nor does it certify floors to be level.  Soil in the Central Texas area is known to be unstable and unpredictable.  Should you have present or future concerns regarding the foundation's condition, you are strongly advised to consult with your builder and/or a licensed Professional Structural Engineer for further evaluation

## Heavy Foliage:

The heavy foliage around the structure should be trimmed and lowered to allow observation for insect activity.  This condition is also conducive to moisture issues.

Evidence of Water Penetration: No

Area Drains Present: Yes (Drains Not Tested and Termination Points are Not Determined)

<!-- image -->

## Additional Information:

The strategy of a foundation is important.  Expansive clay soils, which are found in this part of Texas, can be very destructive to a foundation if the moisture content of the perimeter varies.  The industry standard is a grading slope of six inches within the first ten feet of a foundation.  Excessive moisture forming near a structure can be destructive to a foundation.  If adding soil to the perimeter to create positive drainage, remember to the keep the soil level at least 4 inches from the top of the foundation.  If you are able to verify that the structure is built on a clay type soil (as determined by a soil analysis testing) then that type of soil should be used to raise the soil level.  Porous soils should be avoided.

Ideally finished grade, including flower bed soil, should be 4'from the top of the foundation to help prevent conducive conditions for water penetration and/or wood destroying insects.

It is recommended that all areas where expansive or collapsible soils are known to exist, a controlled method of water disposal from the roofs that will collect and discharge all roof drainage to the ground surface at least 5' from the foundation or to an approved drainage system.

## Specific Limitations:

Note:  Specific Limitations.  The inspector is not required to:

- (A) inspect flatwork or detention/retention ponds (except as related to slope and drainage);
- (B) determine area hydrology or the presence of underground water; or
- drainage systems. (C) determine the efficiency or performance of underground or surface

tion of soil stability During heavy rains, the accumulation of water on this lot may be unavoidable.  An evalua is beyond the scope of this inspection.  Client is advised to keep soil levels 6'-8' from top of slab and graded away to promote positive drainage and prevent water from ponding around the foundation.  High soil is a conducive condition to wood destroying insects.

## 1: Downspouts Drain Near Property

Recommendation

## I NI NP D

NI=Not Inspected

NP=Not Present

D=Deficient

One or more downspouts drain too close to the property foundation. This can result in excessive moisture in the soil at the foundation, which can lead to foundation/structural movement. Recommend a qualified contractor adjust downspout extensions to drain at least 6 feet from the foundation.

Here is a helpful DIY link and video on draining water flow away from your property.

Roof materials have a limited service life and may require spot repairs should leaks develop prior to replacement.  Roof maintenance is an ongoing process and includes keeping the roof free of tree debris, replacing any loose, damaged, or missing shingles, and sealing any gaps at flashing materials.  This report neither addresses future roof leaks nor does it certify the roof to be leak-free.  A roofing specialist should be consulted about any concerns over roof covering life expectancy or the potential for future problems.  Please note: Homeowners insurance companies use different standards and criteria for determining whether they will issue an insurance policy.  These standards differ from each insurance company, as each has their own standards.  Please be advised that this report does not certify nor guarantee that an insurance company will accept or reject an insurance policy based on the condition of this roof.  This roof is not inspected for Insurability or Life Expectancy, and is inspected for function ONLY.  As the purchaser, you may wish to have your insurance carrier inspect for insurance coverage.

## H. Windows

Comments:

Window Type: Vinyl - Double pane insulated

Specific Limitations:

Note:  Specific Limitations.  The inspector is not required to:

- roken seals; (A) exhaustively inspect insulated windows for evidence of b
- (B) exhaustively inspect glazing for identifying labels; or
- (C) identify specific locations of damage.

The inspector does not inspect or comment on the presence or condition of storm windows, awnings, shutters, or other security devices or systems.  Failed thermal seals in insulated windows are not always detectable, depending upon atmospheric conditions or if they are particularly dirty or otherwise obstructed. Visible signs of voided (lost thermal seal) insulated windows can fluctuate with changes in lighting, temperature and/or humidity.  Only obvious seal failure (window fogging) is noted in this report.  Windows can be constructed with multiple sashes and/or lites which could increase the number of actual voided glazed panels. Should this be a concern, our client should contact a glass window specialist to determine if any additional windows have broken seals.  The inspector does not remove any screens or inspect windows which would require a ladder to inspect

## Thermal Pane Windows:

As THERMAL PANE WINDOWS lose their vacuum, moisture may appear, and then disappear, depending on inside and outside temperature, barometric pressure and the relative humidity.  Windows are listed as OBSERVED AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION ONLY, and NO WARRANTY IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  If voided or damaged thermal panes are noted on the inspection report, we would strongly urge that a qualified glass company or glazier be contacted for a further evaluation and any estimates that might be needed.

## Window Access:

Not all windows were accessible for inspection.  Some of the windows could not be properly inspected, due to the presence of furniture, stored goods and/or delicate items, which are not moved during an inspection. When these items are removed, there is a possibility that problems will be discovered that were not visible at the time of the inspection.

## Specific Limitations:

Note:  Specific Limitations.  The system fan and evaporative coil are not readily accessible for inspection without disassembly of the unit. Because we do not disassemble equipment, the condition of the system interior is unknown.  If the system does not have a documented history of regular cleaning and maintenance, servicing by a licensed HVAC technician is required.  Recommend annual cleaning and service by licensed HVAC technician.  The inspector will not pressure test the system coolant or determine the presence of leaks; or operate setback features on thermostats or controls.  We do not inspect for efficiency, capacity or adequacy of units, and the secondary drain lines are not traced for termination.  Secondary drain lines are not tested for proper drainage.  The inspector will describe the type of cooling system and its energy sources and inspect each unit.

The inspector does not determine the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) rating of the HVAC system. This equipment rating is published in the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute ARI directory. The inspector does not determine if an air conditioning units condensing coils and evaporating coils are "matched" according to the manufacturer's specifications.  If any concerns exist about the "matching" of evaporator coils with condensing coils, a qualified HVAC technician should evaluate the complete HVAC system.

## Evaporative Coil (s):

The coils of the indoor portion of the HVAC system were not actually observed and are beyond the scope of this visual inspection.  The 'indoor' coils are enclosed within the actual cabinet which would require specialized tools / equipment to access.  The HVAC unit's warranty could be voided if an unqualified nonLicensed HVAC technician were to cut into the plenum, damage sealant, remove support strapping mounted in the evaporator coil's access panel, remove flues and/or remove any of the ductwork. If documentation is unavailable on the maintenance history of the units or if any concerns exist about the condition of the coils, a qualified licensed HVAC technician should evaluate the complete HVAC system.

Pest Control:

The Structural Pest Control Act requires inspection of only those areas which are visible and accessible at the time of inspection. Some areas of the structure are not accessible to inspection, such as the interior of hollow walls, spaces between floors, areas concealed by carpeting, appliances, furniture or cabinets. Infestations may be active in these areas without visible and accessible evidence. If you desire information about areas that were not inspected, a further inspection may be performed at an additional cost. Carpets, furniture, or appliances are not moved during a routine inspection.  Only a visual, non-invasive inspection is performed at the time of inspection.  In conjunction with the inspection findings within this report, it is recommended that pest control service be utilized at the property for ongoing and/or preventative measures.

Items Beyond the Inspection Scope:

Refrigerators Are Not Inspected.

pumps are not inspected. Expansion tanks and recirculating

Water filtration or softening systems are not inspected.

Instant hot water dispensers are not inspected.

Any landscape lighting, patio storage buildings, hot tubs, misting systems, security systems, surround sound systems/wiring, internet connections, and satellite systems that could be present are beyond the scope of this home inspection, and were not inspected.

Purpose: This is a one-time inspection of the subject property to identify and disclose visually observable major deficiencies of the inspected systems and items at the time of inspection only. Our comments are meant to educate and to provide our Client(s) with information about the areas in which the building or home may be deficient.  Our intent is not to require every item below to be corrected by the seller.  The buyer, seller, and their agents should use this report merely as a tool toward negotiation of a purchase and sell agreement. Homes do not 'Pass' or 'Fail' an inspection.

This inspection is not to be technically exhaustive nor is it considered to be a guarantee or warranty, expressed or implied, regarding the conditions of the property.

Scope &amp; Exclusions: This is a visual inspection only.  We cannot see into, or behind, walls and we will not attempt to report on systems, items, or conditions that are not readily accessible.  We do not disassemble anything.  We do not inspect for any environmental issues such as RADON GAS, LEAD PAINT, FORMALDEHYDE, UREA, MOLDS, ASBESTOS, FUNGUS, SOIL CONTAMINATION, MICROWAVE RADIATION, or any other types of contaminants or microbiological organisms.

We do not inspect for building code compliance, building value, appraisal or cost estimates, soil analysis, adequacy of design, underground pipes or drains, capacity, efficiency, size, value, flood plain location, termite, pest or other real property destroying organisms, or habitability. Detached structures are not included in the inspection unless specifically agreed upon by both the inspector and the client.  The above list of exclusions is not all inclusive.

We do not move furniture, rugs, paintings, or other furniture.  There is no responsibility expressed or implied for latent defects, or for defects not reasonably observable at the time of inspection, or for defects that would require the removal of major or permanent coverings for observation.  No representation is made as to the future performance of any item.  Inspection of water wells, septic systems, security systems, or fire protection equipment (other than smoke detectors) will not be inspected where state /city / county codes, special training, or certification may be additionally required.

We do not hold ourselves to be specialists for any particular item; nor are we engineers. We are a general real estate inspection company.

PLEASE NOTE: GreenWorks does not inspect for MOLD, MILDEW, FUNGUS and / or SPORES as a part of the standard Texas Real Estate Commission Inspection, UNLESS a separate mold inspection has been ordered PRIOR to date of Standard Home Inspection. If conditions of water penetration and / or migration are reported, it is assumed that conditions can and may exist that would support MOLD, MILDEW, FUNGUS and / or SPORES. While the condition of water penetration and / or migration, if visible and accessible, would be reported to the consumer, the condition of MOLD, MILDEW, FUNGUS and / or SPORES would not be tested, or inspected for.  Mold inspections are separate inspections, and require a licensed Mold specialist to comment on, and test for, and report on the presence/absence of Mold, Mildew, Fungus, and spores.
